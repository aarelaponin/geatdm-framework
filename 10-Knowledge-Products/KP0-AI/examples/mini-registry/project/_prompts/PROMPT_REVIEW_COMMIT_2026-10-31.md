# INSTRUCTION — Review the report of the commit of the day

**Suggested model: Sonnet, effort medium.**

## 1. Role and where to run

You are a reviewing session for the mini registry, `MR · review · commit of the day`. **Who may take it:** a session that neither wrote nor carried out the instruction under review; if you did either, stop and say so. You run on the owner's Mac through Desktop Commander's `start_process` (zsh): load it with ToolSearch by its full name, `select:mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__start_process,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__read_file,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__write_file`, or by function where that name is absent; prove it with `date -u; hostname`. Run programs with `/usr/bin/python3`.

**Your first act** is this task's `started` entry:

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/ledger.py" started --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-10 --session "MR · review · commit of the day" --shell native --instruction ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_REVIEW_COMMIT_2026-10-31.md --effort unknown --started-by sub-session --account <the address your own context names as the user's address, or unknown> --by "MR · review · commit of the day"
```

## 2. Read first

The procedure, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md`; the review form, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/REVIEW-template.md`; the instruction under review, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_COMMIT_2026-10-31.md`; the report under review, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports/REPORT_COMMIT_2026-10-31.md`, read as it stands — where it is absent, say so and judge nothing; `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/FINDING-KINDS.md`.

## 3. The task, fixed

The eight things of part one of the review form, in order, written to `downstream_artefact`, evidence under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit-review/_evidence/`. Change nothing; run no git command that writes.

- **The tests** A1 to A6, each re-run by you. For A1, `git status` will now also show the files the round wrote after its commit — its report, its evidence — and the ledger entries written since, yours among them: name each such line and say whether it is one of those; any other line is a finding.
- **One figure re-established:** the number of files in each commit, counted by `git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD` against `HEAD~1`, or `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD`, a route the report did not use.
- **Nothing ignored committed:** `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` in each.
- **The page of the kind and the running application:** not applicable.
- **The mechanical checks:** the trace check over the report; `ledger.py show --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-09` and `ledger.py check --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md`. No record was kept, by the instruction; say so.
- **The verdict**, gaps each with one kind from `FINDING-KINDS.md`; **found, not fixed.**

## 4. The last act
