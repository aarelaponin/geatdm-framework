# INSTRUCTION — Review the report of the paper answering the groundwork's 14 questions

**Suggested model: Opus, effort high.**

## 1. Role and where to run

You are a reviewing session for the mini registry, `MR · review · answers to the groundwork's questions`. **Who may take it:** a session that neither wrote nor carried out the instruction under review; if you did either, stop and say so. You run on the owner's Mac through Desktop Commander's `start_process` (zsh): load it with ToolSearch by its full name, `select:mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__start_process,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__read_file,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__write_file`, or by function where that name is absent; prove it with `date -u; hostname`. Run programs with `/usr/bin/python3`.

**Your first act** is this task's `started` entry:

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/ledger.py" started --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-12 --session "MR · review · answers to the groundwork's questions" --shell native --instruction ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md --effort unknown --started-by sub-session --account <the address your own context names as the user's address, or unknown> --by "MR · review · answers to the groundwork's questions"
```

## 2. Read first

The procedure, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md`; the review form, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/REVIEW-template.md`; the page of the kind, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_kinds/analysis.md`; the instruction under review, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md` — its section 3 sets the paper's shape, and its section 2, item 5, what of the gaps paper is ruled; the report under review, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports/REPORT_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md`, read as it stands — where it is absent, say so and judge nothing; the paper, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/QUESTIONS-PAPER.md`; the sources; `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/FINDING-KINDS.md`.

## 3. The task, fixed

The eight things of part one of the review form, in order, written to `downstream_artefact`, evidence under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02b-questions-review/_evidence/`. Change nothing else; repair nothing; commission nothing.

- **The tests** A1 to A11, each on evidence you read or produced.
- **One figure re-established:** the "Taken together" numbers, by a toy run of your own, written from the recommendations as the paper states them, not from the round's program.
- **What a review of this kind runs** (the analysis page, part 2): every citation read at its source against the sentence that cites it; the 14 questions listed again by you and compared both ways; each table read against the paper's "Given to every position" section and against the other position's cells, for a fact denied to one position that the sources or the paper grant (page items 2, 5 and 6). **The verdict judges whether the paper does what its instruction asks, at the size it asks; it does not judge whether you would recommend the same, and a gap is a fault that a ruling on the paper would carry into round 5, not a sentence you would word differently.**
- **The mechanical checks:** trace over the report; placement over the instruction under review; `round_record.py check` over the record the report's `record` line names, with the options its `check.out` prints on `# run with:` and an `--out` of your own; `ledger.py show --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-11` and `ledger.py check --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md`, quoting the lines naming `MR`. Run the layer's checks directly, not through `round_record.py run`.
- **The verdict**, each gap with one kind from `FINDING-KINDS.md`, and any fault the page lacks named; **found, not fixed.**

## 4. The last act

## Version 2 — 31 October 2026, 2026-10-31 15:45 UTC: the review of the second attempt

The first edition, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reviews/REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md`, found the paper not accepted on G1. The working instruction is now at version 2, which appends G1 and four of the first edition's "found, not fixed" items, with tests A12 to A14. This edition is written by a new session with an empty memory, as `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reviews/REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md`, beside the first; its evidence goes to `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02b-questions-v2-review/_evidence/`. Your entries are those of sections 1 and 4, with `--report` in the `finished` entry naming this edition's file.

**What this edition judges:** tests A1 to A14 of the working instruction's version 2; whether G1 is closed **for every question** — build each rival with every other recommendation by your own program, not the round's, and compare with what each table says; and whether the four items taken up are closed. A gap closed only for Q-6 is not closed. As before, the verdict judges whether the paper does what its instruction asks; a gap is a fault a ruling would carry into round 5.
