# INSTRUCTION — Review the report of round 4, the count

**Suggested model: Opus, effort high.**

## 1. Role and where to run

You are a reviewing session for the mini registry, `MR · review · the count`. **Who may take it:** a session that neither wrote nor carried out the instruction under review; if you did either, stop and say so. You run on the owner's Mac through Desktop Commander's `start_process` (zsh): load it with ToolSearch by its full name, `select:mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__start_process,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__read_file,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__write_file`, or by function where that name is absent; prove it with `date -u; hostname`. Run programs with `/usr/bin/python3`.

**Your first act** is this task's `started` entry:

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/ledger.py" started --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-20 --session "MR · review · the count" --shell native --instruction ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_REVIEW_COUNT_2026-10-31.md --effort unknown --started-by sub-session --account <the address your own context names as the user's address, or unknown> --by "MR · review · the count"
```

## 2. Read first

The procedure, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md`; the review form, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/REVIEW-template.md`; the page of the kind, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_kinds/checking.md`; the instruction under review, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_COUNT_2026-10-31.md` — its section 2, item 5, names the two sets and what of the paper is ruled; the report under review, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports/REPORT_COUNT_2026-10-31.md`, read as it stands — where it is absent, say so and judge nothing; `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/COUNT.md` and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/count/count.csv`; the register and the goal; `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/FINDING-KINDS.md`.

## 3. The task, fixed

The eight things of part one of the review form, in order, written to `downstream_artefact`, evidence under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count-review/_evidence/`. Change nothing else; repair nothing; commission nothing.

- **The tests** A1 to A9, each on evidence you read or produced.
- **The figure re-established by the second route** (the checking page, part 2, and its part 3: the route is named here so that the report cannot borrow it): **count from the goal's own citations** — for each step and failure of `GOAL.md`, the `R-<nn>` its `source` names, and for F-6, F-7 and the amended elements, the requirements "Taken together" and the ruled proposals cite. Build your own pairs from those citations, count both ways, and set your totals beside `COUNT.md`'s. Where the two routes differ, name each pair in one and not the other and say which route is right for it, from the requirement's test. A difference is not by itself a gap; a pair the round asserts that the test does not carry, or a pair the test carries that the round missed, is.
- **The check repeated on another member** (part 2): take three requirements the round did not quote in its report, and read their tests against the goal yourself.
- **The planted fault** (part 2): give the round's program a case it must fail — a copy of `count.csv` with one requirement's every row removed — and see it fail.
- **The mechanical checks**, run directly, not through `round_record.py run`: trace over the report; placement over the instruction under review; `round_record.py check` over the record the report's `record` line names, with the options its `check.out` prints on `# run with:` and an `--out` of your own; `ledger.py show --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-19` and `ledger.py check --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md`, quoting the lines naming `MR`.
- **The verdict**, each gap with one kind from `FINDING-KINDS.md`, any fault the page lacks named; **found, not fixed.** A gap is a fault that the build of round 6 would inherit from this count, not a pair you would word differently.
