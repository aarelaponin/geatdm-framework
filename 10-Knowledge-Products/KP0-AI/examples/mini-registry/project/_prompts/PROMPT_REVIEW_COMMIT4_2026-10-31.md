# INSTRUCTION — Review the report of the delivery commit

**Suggested model: Sonnet, effort medium.**

## 1. Role and where to run

You are a reviewing session for the mini registry, `MR · review · the delivery commit`. **Who may take it:** a session that neither wrote nor carried out the instruction under review. You run on the owner's Mac through Desktop Commander's `start_process` (zsh): load it with ToolSearch by its full name, `select:mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__start_process,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__read_file,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__write_file`, or by function where that name is absent; prove it with `date -u; hostname`.

**Your first act** is this task's `started` entry:

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/ledger.py" started --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-34 --session "MR · review · the delivery commit" --shell native --instruction ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_REVIEW_COMMIT4_2026-10-31.md --effort unknown --started-by sub-session --account <the address your own context names as the user's address, or unknown> --by "MR · review · the delivery commit"
```

## 2. The task, fixed

Read the procedure, the review form (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/REVIEW-template.md`), the instruction under review and its report as it stands (where absent, say so and judge nothing). Do the eight things of part one of the review form, in order, written to `downstream_artefact`, evidence under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4-review/_evidence/`; change nothing; run no git command that writes.

- **The tests** B1 to B8, each re-read by you. For B3, `git status` now also names what was written after the round's report — its `finished` entry, your own `started` entry, your evidence and review, and `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` rebuilt by those entries: attribute each line by its file's modification time and its place, and count any line that is none of these as a finding.
- **One figure re-established:** the file count of each new commit, by `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD`, a route the report did not use.
- **The mechanical checks:** the trace check over the report; `ledger.py show --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-33` and `ledger.py check --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md`, quoting the lines naming `MR`.
- **The verdict**, each gap with one kind from `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/FINDING-KINDS.md`; **found, not fixed.** A gap is a fault in what was committed or in the report's account of it; a criterion that cannot be met as written is named as such, with its line.
