# INSTRUCTION — Review the report of the commit of the day

**Suggested model: Sonnet, effort medium.**

## 1. Role and where to run

You are a reviewing session for the mini registry, `MR · review · third commit of the day`. **Who may take it:** a session that neither wrote nor carried out the instruction under review; if you did either, stop and say so. You run on the owner's Mac through Desktop Commander's `start_process` (zsh): load it with ToolSearch by its full name, `select:mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__start_process,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__read_file,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__write_file`, or by function where that name is absent; prove it with `date -u; hostname`. Run programs with `/usr/bin/python3`.

**Your first act** is this task's `started` entry:

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/ledger.py" started --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-24 --session "MR · review · third commit of the day" --shell native --instruction ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md --effort unknown --started-by sub-session --account <the address your own context names as the user's address, or unknown> --by "MR · review · third commit of the day"
```

## 2. Read first

The procedure, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md`; the review form, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/REVIEW-template.md`; the instruction under review, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md`; the report under review, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports/REPORT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md`, read as it stands — where it is absent, say so and judge nothing; `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/FINDING-KINDS.md`.

## 3. The task, fixed

The eight things of part one of the review form, in order, written to `downstream_artefact`, evidence under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-review/_evidence/`. Change nothing; run no git command that writes.

- **The tests** A1 to A6, each re-run by you. For A1, `git status` will now also show the files the round wrote after its commit — its report, its evidence — and the ledger entries written since, yours among them: name each such line and say whether it is one of those; any other line is a finding.
- **One figure re-established:** the number of files in each commit, counted by `git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD` against `HEAD~1`, or `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD`, a route the report did not use.
- **Nothing ignored committed:** `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` in each.
- **The page of the kind and the running application:** not applicable.
- **The mechanical checks:** the trace check over the report; `ledger.py show --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-23` and `ledger.py check --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md`. No record was kept, by the instruction; say so.
- **The verdict**, gaps each with one kind from `FINDING-KINDS.md`; **found, not fixed.**

## 4. The last act

## Version 2 — 31 October 2026, 2026-10-31 19:19 UTC: the review of the second attempt

The first edition, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reviews/REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md`, found gaps G1 and G2, both from the instruction's own criteria. The working instruction is now at version 2, which keeps its evidence outside the repositories until after the commit and judges by B1 to B3 with A2, A3, A5 and A6. This edition is written by a new session with an empty memory, as `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reviews/REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31_v2.md`; its evidence goes to `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-v2-review/_evidence/`. Your entries are those of sections 1 and 4, with `--report` in the `finished` entry naming this edition's file. Judge B1 to B3 and A2, A3, A5, A6 by your own reading of both repositories; re-establish the file count of each new commit by a route the report did not use.
