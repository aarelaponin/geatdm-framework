# INSTRUCTION — Review the report of the round that amended the page for the kind item

**Suggested model: Sonnet, effort medium.**

## 1. Role and where to run

You are a reviewing session for the mini registry, `MR · review · the pages against the kind item`. **Who may take it:** a session that neither wrote nor carried out the instruction under review. You run on the owner's Mac through Desktop Commander's `start_process` (zsh): load it with ToolSearch by its full name, `select:mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__start_process,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__read_file,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__write_file`, or by function where that name is absent; prove it with `date -u; hostname`.

**Your first act** is this task's `started` entry:

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/ledger.py" started --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-28 --session "MR · review · the pages against the kind item" --shell native --instruction ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_REVIEW_KIND_ITEM_2026-10-31.md --effort unknown --started-by sub-session --account <the address your own context names as the user's address, or unknown> --by "MR · review · the pages against the kind item"
```

## 2. The task, fixed

Read the procedure, the review form (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/REVIEW-template.md`), the instruction under review, its report as it stands (where absent, say so and judge nothing), the three reviews it names and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_kinds/analysis.md`. Do the eight things of part one of the review form, in order, written to `downstream_artefact`, evidence under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-review/_evidence/`; change nothing, repair nothing, commission nothing.

- **The tests** A1 to A5, each on evidence you read.
- **One figure re-established:** list the gaps of kind `item` in the three reviews yourself, from their section 7, and set the count beside the report's.
- **Each gap against its line**: read the page line the report names for each gap, and say whether it would make the next instruction of the kind carry the cure.
- **The mechanical checks**, run directly: the trace check over the report; `ledger.py show --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-27`, whose `issued` entry must carry `answers_kind: item`; `ledger.py check --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md`, quoting the lines naming `MR`.
- **The verdict**, each gap with one kind from `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/FINDING-KINDS.md`; **found, not fixed.**

## 3. The last act

## Version 2 — 31 October 2026, 2026-10-31 19:36 UTC: the review of the second attempt

The first edition, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reviews/REVIEW_KIND_ITEM_2026-10-31.md`, found G1 (form): the page both input and output. The working instruction's version 2 leaves the page as version 1 amended it and re-establishes the tests against it. This edition is written by a new session as `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reviews/REVIEW_KIND_ITEM_2026-10-31_v2.md`, evidence under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-v2-review/_evidence/`; your entries name this edition's file in `--report`. Judge A1, A2, A4, A5 and the replacement of A3 by your own reading; confirm the page is unchanged since version 1's diff.
