# INSTRUCTION — Write a short paper that recommends an answer to each of the groundwork's 14 open questions, for the owner's ruling

**Suggested model: Opus, effort high.** The sources bound every position; the risk is inexactness and inconsistency over fourteen answers (section 7 of the procedure, the second question).

## 1. Role and where to run

You are a working session for the mini registry, started under the name `MR · work · answers to the groundwork's questions`. You run on the owner's Mac, `MacBookPro`, through Desktop Commander's `start_process` (zsh) and its file tools. Load them with ToolSearch by their full names before any command — `select:mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__start_process,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__read_file,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__write_file`; where that exact name is absent, search by function (`start_process`, `desktop-commander`, `+remote-devices process`) and load what comes back by its exact full name. Prove the shell with `date -u; hostname`; only then may you say it is unavailable, with what you searched, what came back and the exact error. Run every program with `/usr/bin/python3` (3.9.6), never `python3` (3.7.9).

**Your first act**, once you have read this declaration, is this task's `started` entry:

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "<orchestrator>/scripts/ledger.py" started --constants <coordination> --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-11 --session "MR · work · answers to the groundwork's questions" --shell native --instruction <root>/_prompts/PROMPT_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md --effort unknown --started-by <owner, sub-session or unknown, from your own prompt> --account <the address your own context names as the user's address, or unknown> --by "MR · work · answers to the groundwork's questions"
```

**Where it refuses because the task waits** for the commit of the day, write nothing anywhere and stop, quoting what it printed. Where it cannot run, record that as it stands. Your account is read from your own context only; your computer is what `hostname` prints. Then read the produced Open block of `<root>/WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`: where a running task names a file you would write, do not write it; say so and stop.

## 2. Read first, in this order

1. `<orchestrator>/SKILL.md` — the procedure; section 5 on how a decision is closed.
2. `<root>/_kinds/analysis.md` — the page of the kind, including its item 6, added today.
3. The kind has no skill of its own; this line says so.
4. `<root>/CONSTANTS.md`.
5. **The sources, in order of precedence:** the brief, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/brief/MINI-REGISTRY-BRIEF.md`; the accepted register, `<root>/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`; the owner's thirteen rulings, which are the summary rows of `<root>/docs/GAPS-PAPER.md`, lines 26 to 38, and the one-sentence recommendation closing each of its question sections — **nothing else in that paper is ruled**; and the accepted groundwork, `<root>/docs/GROUNDWORK.md` and `<root>/docs/groundwork/` — its closing section, "Gaps against the sources", holds the 14 questions.
6. `<orchestrator>/references/REPORT-template.md`.

Check the sha256 of each against these, read 2026-10-31 15:06 UTC; where one differs, stop and say so: brief `ec6971e74a6a8387de0e5bd7a5e1cdead6ddf711b8fdac3ccc1d4b7555e11f64`; register `ad583b3958fb5c5fdf6683b5c2487b6f0c425d66cebc7c46811e2e19af13f103`; gaps paper `d03db64c6e49a1b92467c1e6e19929c321964bd89f6cb715d15dd570f37bc8bb`; groundwork, the four files as they stand when you start — record their checksums first.

## 3. The task

Write `<root>/docs/QUESTIONS-PAPER.md`, **under 20 KB**: one recommended answer to each of the 14 questions, so that the owner can rule on all of them in one act and round 5 can make the data from the sources and his ruling.

**The previous paper of this kind failed review twice** on consistency across a large grid: options judged on facts the paper granted elsewhere, settings credited to one option that any option could take (`<root>/_reviews/REVIEW_GAPS_2026-10-31.md` and `_v2.md`, section 7). This paper is shaped to avoid that:

- **First, one section "Given to every position"**: everything the sources fix — the brief, the register, the thirteen rulings, the groundwork — stated once, by citation, and given to every position of every question. No position may be judged on lacking one of them.
- **Then the set**: the 14 questions, each quoted word for word from `GROUNDWORK.md` with its line, listed by a command into `<root>/_working/round-02b-questions/_evidence/QUESTIONS.md` and counted.
- **Then one short section per question**, in this order: the question; the passages of the sources that bear on it, quoted with path and line, or one line saying none does; **two positions only — the one you recommend and its strongest rival** — each in two or three sentences; one small table, the two positions against the tests that bear (from: what the brief's "What it is for" section says the prototype is for; the brief's "must not" sentences; the known numbers; what rounds 5, 6 and 7 must do), a test that both meet marked so; and the recommendation in one sentence, marked as a proposal. **Where any value within the sources serves equally** — a seed, a date, a first number — say so: the rival is "any other value", the table shows both meet every test, and the recommendation picks one value for a stated convenience.
- **Where one answer depends on another**, say so in one line, "depends on Q-<n>", and judge it with that answer as recommended; never assume another question's recommendation silently.
- **Last, "Taken together"**: a small program, saved in the evidence folder, that builds a toy data set to the recommendations together and prints the known numbers it yields — children, schools, entries, children on more than one list, of those spelt differently, the ages' range, learners after reset — and how many of the 8 the brief's rule catches. Its output is quoted in the paper.

## 4. Constraints and standing rules

- The paper recommends; it decides nothing. No recommendation lets the search compare anything but the three fields of the brief's line 13, forgive anything but capitals, or read the key table.
- No passage restated where it can be quoted; no figure from memory.
- The sources are read and never changed.
- No operation that writes to version control; nothing opens a window.
- Keep the round's record with `round_record.py`: `start` before your first write, with `--record <root>/_working/round-02b-questions/_evidence/record --root <root> --read ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/brief/MINI-REGISTRY-BRIEF.md`; run **your own** programs through `run`; **run the layer's own checks (placement, trace) outside `run`**, directly, their output kept as files; `end` after your last write but the report; `check` last, before the `finished` entry.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **A1** — `QUESTIONS.md` lists the 14 questions, each a substring of `GROUNDWORK.md` at its line; a command prints `14` and `0 not found`.
- **A2** — A command compares the questions with the paper's sections and prints `0 unanswered, 0 extra`.
- **A3** — Every passage the paper quotes is in its file at the line it gives: a command prints `0 not found, 0 wrong line`.
- **A4** — Every question section has exactly two positions, one table and one recommendation marked as a proposal: a command prints the counts per section, and every row reads 2, 1, 1.
- **A5** — The "Taken together" program runs and prints, for the recommendations together: 60 children, 3 schools, 8 children on more than one list, 4 of those spelt differently, ages within 6 to 12, and 68 entries; the report quotes its output with the learners after reset and the number of the 8 the rule catches.
- **A6** — No recommendation widens the search or lets it read the key table: the report says, per question, which part of the search rule or the key table it touches, or "none".
- **A7** — The paper is under 20 KB: `wc -c` quoted.
- **A8** — The sources are unchanged at the end: `shasum -a 256` prints the checksums of section 2 and of the groundwork as recorded at the start.
- **A9** — The placement check over this instruction and the trace check over the report, run outside `run`, exit 0: `/usr/bin/python3 "<orchestrator>/scripts/placement_check.py" --constants <root>/CONSTANTS.md <root>/_prompts/PROMPT_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md`; `/usr/bin/python3 "<orchestrator>/scripts/trace_check.py" --constants <root>/CONSTANTS.md --coordination <coordination> <root>/_reports/REPORT_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md`.
- **A10** — The record check exits 0: `/usr/bin/python3 -B "<orchestrator>/scripts/round_record.py" check --record <root>/_working/round-02b-questions/_evidence/record --report <root>/_reports/REPORT_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md --out <root>/_working/round-02b-questions/_evidence/record/check.out`.
- **A11** — The `started` and `finished` entries stand, as `ledger.py show --constants <coordination> --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-11` prints them beside the `issued` entry.

## 6. Evidence required

For every criterion: the command, its output trimmed but not edited, and the time, under `<root>/_working/round-02b-questions/_evidence/`, cited by path.

## 7. How this round can fail

**The faults of the kind, by reference:** part 1 of `<root>/_kinds/analysis.md`, items 1 to 6.

- **A rival given less than the sources give it.** The "Given to every position" section exists so that no table can deny a rival what the sources grant; before writing each table, read it against that section.
- **A value from the gaps paper taken as ruled.** The paper proposes a seed, a date and which lists carry the 8 in passing; those are not ruled. You may recommend the same values, but as your recommendation, with your ground.
- **The toy run made to agree.** A5's program builds the data from the recommendations as written; where it does not reach a known number, the recommendations are wrong, not the program.

## 8. Out of scope — do not touch

`src/`, the brief, the register, both earlier papers, the groundwork, `CONSTANTS.md`, `_kinds/`; round 3; any commit. Anything found but not asked for goes to the report under "found, not fixed".

## 9. The report

Write the report named in `downstream_artefact`, from the report form, in `<root>/_reports/`, with `upstream_artefact` this file's path and `answers` `C-2026-10-31-11`. Record `ls -ld` of each place written. Do not write the verdict. **Then the `finished` entry:**

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "<orchestrator>/scripts/ledger.py" finished --constants <coordination> --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-11 --report <root>/_reports/REPORT_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md --outcome "<one line: what came of the round, in the words of the report's first paragraph>" --moved "<one line, or nothing>" --account <the same account as your started entry> --by "MR · work · answers to the groundwork's questions"
```

## 10. The review

Once your `finished` entry stands, start the review as a sub-agent with your Agent tool: `subagent_type` `general-purpose`, never a fork, in the foreground; where the tool takes a model and an effort, Opus and high, never lower; `prompt` these three lines, word for word:

```text
MR · review · answers to the groundwork's questions
Carry out the instruction at <root>/_prompts/PROMPT_REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md
Load the shell tool this session has for commands on the computer (desktop-commander where it is present).
```

Never create a scheduled task to start it. Wait for it, add nothing, and end with one line: its verdict line and its path, or why it could not run. Do not judge it; route nothing.
