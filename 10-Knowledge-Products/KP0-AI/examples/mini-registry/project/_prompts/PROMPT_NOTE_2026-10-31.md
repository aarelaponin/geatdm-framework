model: Opus — the content is settled by the accepted rounds and the owner's rulings; what remains is saying it exactly, in the reader's words, on one page; the risk is a claim the record does not carry, or a limit left out
effort: high — the note is the one document that leaves the arrangement, and a senior reader acts on what it says
reviewer: a separate session started from the review instruction below, as a sub-agent of this session; Opus, effort high — the review looks up every claim at its source and lists the limits again

# INSTRUCTION — Write the one-page note to the Permanent Secretary: what the prototype shows, and what it does not

**Suggested model: Opus, effort high.** The record settles every claim; the risk is a claim or a limit inexactly carried into the reader's words (section 7 of the procedure, the second question).

## 1. Role and where to run

You are a working session for the mini registry, started under the name `MR · work · the note to the Permanent Secretary`. You run on the owner's Mac, `MacBookPro`, through Desktop Commander's `start_process` (zsh) and its file tools. Load them with ToolSearch by their full names before any command — `select:mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__start_process,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__read_file,mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__write_file`; where that exact name is absent, search by function (`start_process`, `desktop-commander`, `+remote-devices process`) and load what comes back by its exact full name. Prove the shell with `date -u; hostname`; only then may you say it is unavailable, with what you searched, what came back and the exact error. Run every program with `/usr/bin/python3` (3.9.6), never `python3` (3.7.9).

**Your first act**, once you have read this declaration, is this task's `started` entry:

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/ledger.py" started --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-31 --session "MR · work · the note to the Permanent Secretary" --shell native --instruction ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_NOTE_2026-10-31.md --effort unknown --started-by <owner where the owner typed or pasted your start message; otherwise unknown> --account <the address your own context names as the user's address, or unknown> --by "MR · work · the note to the Permanent Secretary"
```

A session that can tell only that a scheduled task started it writes `unknown`. Your account is read from your own context only; your computer is what `hostname` prints. Then read the produced Open block of `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`: where a running task names a file you would write, do not write it; say so and stop.

## 2. Read first, in this order

1. `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md` — the procedure; section 2.5.4 and 2.5.5 on a reader's rendering.
2. `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_kinds/drafting.md` — the page of the kind, items 1 to 5 of part 1; item 3 above all, the reader's words, and item 4, every limit.
3. `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/READERS-REGISTER.md` — **the register the note is written in**, cited here and not retyped. **The length band is one A4 page** (the register's item 6; the owner's ruling on G-13: one A4 page, as a PDF, counted by its page count).
4. `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/CONSTANTS.md` — section 4: inside Progressa's story the Permanent Secretary receives the note.
5. **The record the note rests on**: the brief, "What it is for" and "What it delivers"; the register, R-23 and its test; the goal, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/GOAL.md`, as ruled on `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/GOAL-QUESTIONS-PAPER.md`; the count, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/COUNT.md`; the duplicates count, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/DUPLICATES.md` — **the search catches 4 of the 8** — and its section "What the figure shows, and what it does not"; what the build's checks run and do not, from `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reviews/REVIEW_BUILD_2026-10-31_v2.md`; and the owner's ruling of 21:56 on three limits kept as built, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/_ledger/20261031T195657Z_MR_ruled_D-2026-10-31-11.yaml`.
6. `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/references/REPORT-template.md`.

Record the sha256 of every source as you start.

## 3. The task

**First, two lists** (the drafting page, item 4), into `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-08-note/_evidence/` before the note is written:

- `CLAIMS.md` — every claim the note will make, each with the source it rests on, by path and line, and the words there that carry it.
- `LIMITS.md` — **every limit the record names**, listed from the sources: what the brief says the prototype is not; that the data is invented; that nothing connects to another body; the 4 of the 8 the search misses and why; a different child sharing the three fields taken for a learner; the case of more than one learner found, checked only on a record the check writes; an entry of any blank characters taken as missing; a fourth school not kept on the way back; and any other a source names. For each: whether the note states it, or why it is left out of one page — the report repeats the list.

**Then the note**, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/NOTE.md`, its source, in the register: addressed to the Permanent Secretary; the answer first — what the prototype shows — then what it does not; on one A4 page; no path, no code, no requirement number, no account of the rounds; the figure "4 of the 8" stated with its meaning in the reader's words.

**Then the build**, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/note/build.py`: from `NOTE.md` to `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/note/NOTE.pdf`, an A4 PDF, offline and with no window — Python's standard library to make HTML, and macOS's `cupsfilter` (or another tool you show to open no window and fetch nothing) to make the PDF. The PDF is a build: never edited by hand, rebuilt from the source. It is not sent: sending it is the owner's.

## 4. Constraints and standing rules

- No claim the record does not carry (the drafting page, item 1); no reader's word the register forbids (item 3).
- The sources are read and never changed; nothing under `src/` is touched.
- No figure from memory; no operation that writes to version control; nothing opens a window; nothing is sent to anybody.
- Keep the round's record with `round_record.py`: `start` before your first write, with `--record ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-08-note/_evidence/record --root ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry`; run **your own** programs through `run`; **run the layer's own checks outside `run`**; `end` after your last write but the report; run `check` last and quote it. No criterion rests on it.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- **A1** — `CLAIMS.md` comes before the note, and every claim of the note is one of its rows: a command shows each claim's source words at the line it gives → `0 not found`; the report pairs each sentence of the note with its row.
- **A2** — `LIMITS.md` lists the limits from the sources, and each is either in the note or in the report's list of what was left out, with the reason → `0 unaccounted`.
- **A3** — **The register's self-test first**: `/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/readers_register_selftest.py"` exits 0; **then** `/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/readers_register_check.py" ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/NOTE.md` exits 0, or every match is a named exception kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/note/` with its reason and repeated in the report.
- **A4** — `NOTE.pdf` has exactly one page, A4: its page count and page size read from the file by a command (595 by 842 points, within a point), quoted.
- **A5** — R-23's test, as the register gives it: the note as built is one page, addressed to the Permanent Secretary, says what the prototype shows and says what it does not — each quoted from the PDF's extracted text.
- **A6** — `build.py` run twice gives the same text in the PDF (the bytes may differ by a timestamp): the extracted text of the two compared.

*Reading the PDF's text, for A5 and A6:* by PDFKit through `osascript -l JavaScript`, which opens no window, or another offline route you show to open none. Where no route reads it, keep each command tried and what it printed (the building page's item 7 holds here too), and compare instead the HTML `build.py` made, showing that the PDF was made from that HTML in the same run.
- **A7** — The sources are unchanged: their sha256 at the end equals that at the start.
- **A8** — The placement check over this instruction and the trace check over the report, run outside `run`, exit 0: `/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/placement_check.py" --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/CONSTANTS.md ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_NOTE_2026-10-31.md`; `/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/trace_check.py" --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/CONSTANTS.md --coordination ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports/REPORT_NOTE_2026-10-31.md`.
- **A9** — The `started` and `finished` entries stand, as `ledger.py show --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-31` prints them beside the `issued` entry.

## 6. Evidence required

For every criterion: the command, its output trimmed but not edited, and the time, under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-08-note/_evidence/`, cited by path. Every figure the report gives twice is the same both times, and the `finished` entry's outcome agrees with the report's first paragraph.

## 7. How this round can fail

**The faults of the kind, by reference:** part 1 of `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_kinds/drafting.md`, items 1 to 5.

- **The limit of one step stated as a limit of the whole** (item 4): the search misses a child spelt differently; that is a limit of the search step, not that the registry cannot find the child.
- **The apparatus leaking in**: "R-12", "F-5", "round 7", "the ledger", a file name — each is the working register, not the reader's.
- **One page met by shrinking the type**: the page is A4 at a size a person reads; where the claims do not fit, the report says which were left out and why, never the type made smaller than 10 points.

## 8. Out of scope — do not touch

`src/`, every accepted document, the ignore list, any commit; sending the note. Anything found but not asked for goes to the report under "found, not fixed".

## 9. The report

Write the report named in `downstream_artefact`, from the report form, in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports/`, with `upstream_artefact` **this file's path** and `answers` `C-2026-10-31-31`. Record `ls -ld` of each place written. Do not write the verdict. **Then the `finished` entry:**

```text
/usr/bin/python3 "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/ffbe2f0e-bc4b-46d3-ad76-b08a7882aae9/7bbcb800-2754-4c5e-97ea-ccb874ea3fee/rpm/plugin_018SiGJfFaxxAvevS4xGQJgb/skills/orchestrator/scripts/ledger.py" finished --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-31 --report ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports/REPORT_NOTE_2026-10-31.md --outcome "<one line: what came of the round, in the words of the report's first paragraph>" --moved "<docs/NOTE.md and its build, for the owner to send>" --account <the same account as your started entry> --by "MR · work · the note to the Permanent Secretary"
```

## 10. The review

Once your `finished` entry stands, start the review as a sub-agent with your Agent tool: `subagent_type` `general-purpose`, never a fork, in the foreground; where the tool takes a model and an effort, Opus and high, never lower; `prompt` these three lines, word for word:

```text
MR · review · the note to the Permanent Secretary
Carry out the instruction at ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_REVIEW_NOTE_2026-10-31.md
Load the shell tool this session has for commands on the computer (desktop-commander where it is present).
```

Never create a scheduled task to start it. Wait for it, add nothing, and end with one line: its verdict line and its path, or why it could not run. Do not judge it; route nothing.

## Version 2 — 31 October 2026, 2026-10-31 21:09 UTC: the gap of the review

The review of version 1, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reviews/REVIEW_NOTE_2026-10-31.md`, is **not accepted** on one gap, G1 (item, A2): the ruled limit that a name has no longest length and no character refused (the owner's ruling on the goal's questions, Q-4: «no length and no character refused») is neither in the note nor in the report's list of what was left out. Every other claim and limit held. Read the review's sections 7 and 8 in full. **The owner does not send the note** (his word of 22:52 Tallinn time, 31 October 2026): it is a prototype's note, built and kept as a source, never sent.

This version is carried out by a new session with an empty memory. It changes `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/NOTE.md` only as this section asks, rebuilds `NOTE.pdf` with `build.py`, keeps its evidence and record under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-08-note-v2/_evidence/`, and writes its report to `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports/REPORT_NOTE_2026-10-31_v2.md`. Your entries are those of sections 1 and 9, with `--report` in the `finished` entry naming this version's report; the program reads the version from this declaration.

**What this version must do:**

- **G1, and the rule behind it for every ruled answer.** List again, into `LIMITS.md` of this version's evidence, every limit the record names — **every closing proposal of the goal's questions paper and of the earlier questions paper, the rulings of 21:56 and the brief's and the register's limits** — and for each say whether the note states it or why it is left out. The limit of Q-4 goes into the note if the one page holds it in the register, or into the left-out list with its reason. Say how many limits the review's G1 rule finds missing in version 1's list besides Q-4's: each is added the same way.
- **Keep everything version 1 got right**: a change to the note is the smallest that carries a missing limit; its claims rows are added to `CLAIMS.md` of this version's evidence.

**The tests of success of this version** are A1 to A9, read with this version's paths, A2 over the new `LIMITS.md`, A4 over the rebuilt PDF.
