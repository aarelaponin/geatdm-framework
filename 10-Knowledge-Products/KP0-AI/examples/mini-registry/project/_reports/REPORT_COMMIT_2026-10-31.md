# ACCOUNT — Commit the day's files in the mini registry's repository and in the coordination's, with no push

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_COMMIT_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-09`) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`, proved by `date -u; hostname`, which printed `Sat Oct 31 15:12:15 UTC 2026` and `MacBookPro`

## 1. The answer first

Both repositories hold one new commit each, made with `git add -A` and the identity git was configured with (Arne Laponin <(account removed)>), and nothing was pushed or added as a remote. The mini registry: `2fad722`, 262 files (260 added, 2 modified, 0 deleted), 17850 insertions. The coordination: `2ba3804`, 30 files (all added: 10 guards and 20 ledger entries, this task's `started` entry among them). Straight after the two commits both `git status --porcelain` printed nothing, and `ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` prints nothing in either. The ignored files (`.DS_Store`; `WHO.html`, `MEASURES.md`) stayed out.

## 2. The criteria, one by one

**A1 — status clean straight after the commits.** Run at 15:13:09 UTC in the same act as the commits, before anything else was written. Met.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit/_evidence/commit_and_A1.txt`:

```text
# 2026-10-31 15:13:09 UTC A1 status straight after
## mini-registry
# exit=0
## _coordination
# exit=0
```

Both outputs are empty: no line stands between a repository's heading and its `# exit=0`.

**A2 — one new commit in each, no remote.** `git log --oneline -3` and `git remote -v` at 15:13:17 UTC, kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit/_evidence/after_mini-registry.txt` and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit/_evidence/after__coordination.txt`. The mini registry's log shows `2fad722` over `74ca995` (the inception commit, which `before_mini-registry.log.txt` shows as HEAD before); the coordination's shows `2ba3804` over `f30bc04` (HEAD before, per `before__coordination.log.txt`). Under `## remote -v` nothing is printed in either, `# remote exit=0`. Met.

**A3 — nothing ignored committed.** `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` at 15:13:17 UTC, in the same two after-files: nothing printed, exit 0, in both. Met.

**A4 — files committed equal to the new and changed lines of the before status.** The before status of section 3 step 1 collapses untracked folders into one line each, so its lines and the committed files cannot be equal; the round therefore also took a file-level listing (`-uall`) before committing and reconciled the two. Counts read by `grep -c` and `show --name-only | grep -c .`:

| Repository | Lines of the before status (folders collapsed) | Lines of the before status, `-uall` | Files in `git show --stat HEAD` |
|---|---|---|---|
| mini-registry | 44 | 261 | 262 |
| _coordination | 30 | 30 | 30 |

The one file of difference in the mini registry is the round's own evidence file `before__coordination.status_uall.txt`, written after the mini registry's `-uall` listing and before its commit. `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit/_evidence/A4_reconcile.txt`:

```text
## mini-registry: committed files not in the -uall before listing
_working/round-commit/_evidence/before__coordination.status_uall.txt
## mini-registry: before listing not committed
## _coordination: committed files not in the -uall before listing
## _coordination: before listing not committed
```

The two modified files gained lines only (`WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` 21 added, 0 removed; `_kinds/analysis.md` 1 added, 0 removed — both changed by earlier rounds of the day, not by this one, which edited no file). Met in substance: every file listed new or changed before is committed and nothing else is but the round's own evidence; the literal equality of the collapsed count (44) with 262 does not hold, and section 5 says why.

**A5 — trace check over this report.** Run after this report is written; its output is kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit/_evidence/trace_check.out`. The exit is recorded there and in the `finished` entry's outcome.

**A6 — started and finished entries in the ledger.** The started entry `20261031T151215Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-09.yaml` stands and is committed in `2ba3804`. The finished entry is written after this report; `ledger.py show` is then run and kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit/_evidence/ledger_show.out`.

## 3. Found, not fixed

- `repo-hygiene` step 3 commits for a `local` project only the files the session can name as its own, "added by path (never `git add -A`)"; this instruction orders `git add -A` at the owner's word. The round followed the instruction.
- The before status of section 3 step 1 (`--porcelain --ignored`) collapses untracked folders, so criterion A4 compares unlike counts; a file-level listing (`-uall`) is the one the criterion needs.

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing beyond A5 and A6, which are settled only after this report is written, by the logs named under them.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

- A4 as written (files in `show --stat` equal to the new and changed lines of the before status) cannot hold whenever an untracked folder is listed as one line; the round answered it with the `-uall` listing instead, and gives both counts above.
- Section 9 asks for `upstream_artefact` `none — the owner's word, as the declaration gives it`; with it the trace check of A5 exited 1 with `names-no-instruction: the report's upstream_artefact names no file` (kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit/_evidence/trace_check_first.out`). The report form requires the instruction by path there, the same file whose `downstream_artefact` names this report, so the line names the instruction; the owner's word stands as the instruction's own upstream.
- The instruction names Sonnet; the session ran on claude-opus-5-5, the scheduled task's model.
- The evidence folder lies inside the mini registry, so the round's before-evidence was written before the commit and is committed in `2fad722` (6 files under `_working/round-commit/_evidence/` at commit time: the five listed by `before_mini-registry.status_uall.txt` and the one named under A4).

## 6. What this round did not finish

Standing uncommitted after the commit, as the instruction expects: in the mini registry, `_working/round-commit/_evidence/commit_and_A1.txt`, `after_mini-registry.txt`, `after__coordination.txt`, `A4_reconcile.txt`, `trace_check.out`, `ledger_show.out`, `window.out`, this report and `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` as rebuilt by the finished entry; in the coordination, this task's `finished` entry and any guard records written by the checks after 15:13:09 UTC. No second commit was made to chase them.

## 7. The outputs, by path

The listing is kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit/_evidence/ls_outputs.txt`, taken by `ls -ld` of each place with its exit code.
