# ACCOUNT — Commit the day's files in the mini registry's repository and in the coordination's, with no push

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-23`) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`, proved by `date -u; hostname`, which printed `Sat Oct 31 19:12:33 UTC 2026` and `MacBookPro`

## 1. The answer first

Both repositories hold one new commit each, made with `git add -A` and the identity git was configured with (Arne Laponin <(account removed)>, none set); nothing was pushed and no remote added. The mini registry: `7f8fa98` over `c419cf3`, 231 files (230 added, 1 modified — `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`), 35371 insertions, 4 deletions. The coordination: `f4c9345` over `42cfa12`, 50 files, all added (14 guards, 36 ledger entries, this task's `started` entry among them). The ignored files (`.DS_Store`; `WHO.html`, `MEASURES.md`) stayed out, and `ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` prints nothing in either. The Open block read after the started entry showed no task running but this one; C-2026-10-31-24, -25 and -26 stood issued and waiting on it.

**One fault of the round's own making:** the evidence file `commit_and_A1.txt` was opened by the shell's redirection before `git add -A` ran in the same act, so it was committed with its first lines only and showed as modified in the A1 status read straight after. The coordination's status was empty; the mini registry's carried that one line. A1 is therefore *not met* as written (section 2).

## 2. The criteria, one by one

**A1 — status clean straight after the commits.** Run at 19:12:56 UTC in the same act as the commits.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3/_evidence/commit_and_A1.txt`:

```text
$ git -C ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry status --porcelain
 M _working/round-commit3/_evidence/commit_and_A1.txt
[end]
$ git -C ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination status --porcelain
[end]
```

The coordination: empty. The mini registry: one line, the round's own evidence file, written into the repository by the same command that committed and read the status — the redirection created the file before `git add -A`, the commit took its contents at that instant (8 lines, `git diff --stat HEAD` on it), and the shell wrote the rest after. No other file was new or changed. **Not met** — the earlier commit round avoided this by holding its output in `/tmp`; this round did not.

**A2 — one new commit in each, no remote.** `git log --oneline -3` and `git remote -v` at 19:13:07–08 UTC, kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3/_evidence/after_mini-registry.txt` and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3/_evidence/after__coordination.txt`. The mini registry's log: `7f8fa98` over `c419cf3` over `2fad722`; the coordination's: `f4c9345` over `42cfa12` over `2ba3804`. Between `$ git -C … remote -v` and `[end remote]` nothing is printed in either. Met.

**A3 — nothing ignored committed.** `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` at the same times, in the same two after-files: nothing between the command and `[end ls-files]` in either. Met.

**A4 — files committed equal to the new and changed files of the before status.** The before status of step 1 (`before_mini-registry.txt`, `before__coordination.txt`) was taken with `--untracked-files=all`, so it lists files, not folders. Its new and changed lines were cut to paths (`before_list_<repo>.txt`) just before `git add -A`, and compared by `diff` with `git show --name-only HEAD` (`committed_list_<repo>.txt`), kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3/_evidence/A4_mini-registry.txt` and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3/_evidence/A4__coordination.txt`.

| Repository | Files new or changed in the before status | Files in `git show --stat HEAD` | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| mini-registry | 229 | 231 | 2, both the round's own evidence |
| _coordination | 50 | 50 | none, `diff exit=0` |

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3/_evidence/A4_mini-registry.txt`:

```text
$ diff before_list_mini-registry.txt committed_list_mini-registry.txt
204a205
> _working/round-commit3/_evidence/before_list__coordination.txt
206a208
> _working/round-commit3/_evidence/commit_and_A1.txt
diff exit=1
```

Every file the before status listed is committed (none missing); the two extra are evidence files the round wrote after the mini registry's list was cut and before its commit. The one modified file, `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`, was rebuilt by `ledger.py` on this round's started entry; this round edited no file's content. Met at the level of files; not literally equal in the mini registry, for the reason given.

**A5 — trace check over this report.** Run after this report is written; its output and exit are kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3/_evidence/trace_check.out`, and the exit is carried in the `finished` entry's outcome.

**A6 — started and finished entries in the ledger.** The started entry `20261031T191233Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-23.yaml` stands and is committed in `f4c9345`. The finished entry is written after this report; `ledger.py show` is then run and kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3/_evidence/ledger_show.out`.

## 3. Found, not fixed

- `repo-hygiene` commits for a `local` project only the files a session can name as its own, never `git add -A`; this instruction orders `git add -A` at the owner's word. The round followed the instruction, as the two earlier commits of the day did.
- The commit round's form does not say where its evidence is to be held during the commit act; writing it inside the repository being committed makes A1 depend on the order of shell redirection. A later instruction could name `/tmp` for that one file.

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing beyond A5 and A6, settled after this report by the logs named under them.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

- The instruction names Sonnet; the session ran on claude-opus-5-5, the scheduled task's model.
- The started entry carries `--started-by owner`; the session was started by a scheduled task's automated firing of the stored start message, which the earlier commit round read as `unknown`. The entry was not rewritten.
- The evidence folder lies inside the mini registry, so the round's before-evidence and its message files (`before_*.txt`, `before_list_*.txt`, `msg_*.txt`, and the partial `commit_and_A1.txt`) were committed in `7f8fa98`.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Standing uncommitted after the commit, as the instruction expects: in the mini registry, `_working/round-commit3/_evidence/commit_and_A1.txt` (modified), `after_*.txt`, `A4_*.txt`, `committed_list_*.txt`, `show_stat_*.txt`, `ls_outputs.txt`, `window.out`, `trace_check.out`, `ledger_show.out`, this report and `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` as rebuilt by the finished entry; in the coordination, this task's `finished` entry and any guard records the checks write after 19:12:56 UTC. No second commit was made to chase them.

## 7. The outputs, by path

The listing is kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3/_evidence/ls_outputs.txt`, taken by `ls -ld` of each place with its exit code.

*Nothing follows in this report; the `finished` entry and the start of the review come after it.*
