window: 2026-10-31 14:16:49 UTC to 2026-10-31 14:19:13 UTC — opened at the round's first command (`date -u; hostname`), closed at this report's last write; read by `date -u` and `stat`, because `round_record.py window` needs a started entry in the ledger and this estate has none; the command and its output kept in ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/window.out
record: none kept by round_record.py, as the instruction's section 5 rules — every write of the round is a git act or one of the two small files, and A1 to A4 prove them; the commands, their outputs and times are kept by hand in ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/

ledger: MR C-2026-10-31-05 — the estate's record is not cut over to the ledger (the instruction's running_record line names a row added by hand); the round took up its row in ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md at 31 Oct 2026, 14:16 UTC, closes it by hand into the Closed table after this report, and writes no ledger entry

# ACCOUNT — Make the coordination folder a git repository on this computer, with no remote, and commit the ledger

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_LEDGER_GIT_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-05`) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`, proved by `date -u; hostname`, which printed `Sat Oct 31 14:16:49 UTC 2026` and `MacBookPro`

Evidence folder: `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/`.

## 1. The answer first

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination` is now a git repository with no remote, holding one commit, `f30bc0451cbd52f947832c417af6c64ec8375b8a`, made at 14:17:46 UTC with the identity already configured (`Arne Laponin <(account removed)>`; none set). It carries 15 files: `CONSTANTS.md`, `projects.txt`, the 7 entries of `_ledger/`, the 4 files of `_guards/`, the new `_ledger/README.md` and the new `.gitignore`, which lists `WHO.html` and `MEASURES.md` and nothing else. No ledger entry appeared while the round worked (7 before, 7 at commit). No file in `_ledger/` or `_guards/` changed, nor `CONSTANTS.md` or `projects.txt`: the only line `diff` adds is the README this round wrote. The cut-over's step-0 reading on the README holds; its reading on a remote comes back empty, by the owner's ruling.

## 2. The criteria, one by one

### A1 — step 0 as the owner ruled it read — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/A1.log`, at 14:17:58 UTC: `rev-parse --show-toplevel` printed `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination`; `ls-files _ledger/README.md` printed `_ledger/README.md`; `remote -v` printed nothing (exit 0).

### A2 — every entry committed — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/A2.log`, at 14:17:58 UTC: `git ls-files _ledger | grep -c '\.yaml$'` printed `7`; `ls _ledger/*.yaml | wc -l` printed `7`. At the moment of the commit, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/step5_commit.log` shows the same 7 `.yaml` files, all carried by `before.sha256`; no new entry was written during the round.

### A3 — nothing left over — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/A3.log`, at 14:17:58 UTC: `status --porcelain` printed nothing; `status --porcelain --ignored` printed only `!! MEASURES.md` and `!! WHO.html`.

### A4 — no entry changed — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/A4.log`, at 14:17:58 UTC: `diff before.sha256 after.sha256` shows one added line and none removed or changed:

```text
7a8
> bbae7c1432ac774bc1d25b34352fdb846e02440405c001e483c1179f614a034d  _ledger/README.md
```

The added line is not a new entry: it is `_ledger/README.md`, written by this round under task step 3. The 11 entry and guard files carry the same checksum before (14:17:21 UTC) and after (14:17:58 UTC). `diff before_other.sha256 after_other.sha256` (`CONSTANTS.md`, `projects.txt`) printed nothing, exit 0. No git attribute was set; `core.autocrlf` and every eol/filter setting are unset (`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/config.log`: no such setting, no `.gitattributes`).

### A5 — the ledger still reads — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/A5.log`, at 14:17:58 UTC: `ledger.py check` exited 1 with one defect line, `not-cut-over: MR — the taken-up entry names …/WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md, which carries no markers …`, and `check: 1 defect`. The README in `_ledger/` raised no defect.

### A6 — the trace check over this report — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-ledger-git/_evidence/A6.log`, at 14:19:01 UTC, run after this report's every section but its window line: `outputs: 5 of 5 named exist`, `trace check: clean`, exit 0. It notes that the ledger holds no issued entry for the instruction, so no input checksum was compared (the record is not cut over). No guard entry was written (`_guards/` still holds 4 files).

### A7 — the row taken up and closed by hand — met at close

Taken up at 14:16 UTC (Started cell replaced in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`); closed into the Closed table after this report, before the review is started.

## 3. Found, not fixed

- `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md` section 5 says the ledger "is written by `ledger.py` and by nothing else", and the README now in `_ledger/` was written by hand at the instruction's demand. The README is not an entry and `ledger.py check` accepts it, but the constants' wording and the README's own second sentence ("every file in it is written by `ledger.py`") do not hold of the README itself. A ruling or a narrower wording is the orchestrator's.
- The commit's author date is recorded in local time (+0200); no consequence, noted for whoever reads `git log` against UTC entries.

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing the criteria ask.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

- The model line names Sonnet; this session ran as `claude-opus-5-5`, the model its scheduled task was configured for.
- Task step 3 asks the README to say "every file in it is written by `ledger.py`", which the README cannot say truly of itself (section 3, first line). Written as asked.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing. The cut-over itself, and the constants' line on keeping the ledger by git (`no`), are out of scope and untouched.

## 7. The outputs, by path
