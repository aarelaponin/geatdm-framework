# ACCOUNT — Write the decision paper that answers the register's open questions G-01 to G-13, each with its positions and a recommendation, for the owner's ruling (version 2)

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_GAPS_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-03`, version 2) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process` (`mcp__remote-devices__plugin_8d52a3a6-3a2d-4a54-8d1d-e08585a97642_desktop-commander__start_process`), proved by `date -u; hostname`, which printed `Sat Oct 31 13:48:20 UTC 2026` and `MacBookPro`

Evidence folder: `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/`, every file below cited by its full path. The paper is cited as `paper:<line>`.

## 1. The answer first

`docs/GAPS-PAPER.md` is changed in place (34390 → 47002 bytes). Every section now quotes the register lines that name its question (all 12 distinct lines, 13 gap-line pairs) and the register tests its judgements rest on, and opens a line **"Given to every position"** naming the settings, counts and screens open to all; the table judges only what divides the positions. G-01 Position C is restated as an opaque number from a seeded generator and judged again: it now meets (c) and (d) as A does, and A is recommended on (a) and (d) alone (A meets register line 93 by construction, C needs a redraw). G-02 is cut back to its one difference — refusing or showing every learner found — with the data setting and the third view given to both. G-05 drops the capitals-only children, which resolves the conflict with R-12's letter-for-letter test. **All thirteen recommendations stand as in version 1**; the figures 64, 68 and 4 of 8 stand, and R-12 now counts 4 whether its comparison heeds capitals or not (`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/figures.log`).

## 2. The criteria, one by one

### A1 — the set: 13 listed, each in the register — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/A1_questions.log` (run 1 of the record, 13:51:58 UTC): `questions in the section: 14` · `questions listed (G-01 to G-13): 13` · `13` (`grep -c` over `QUESTIONS.md`) · `0 not found` (`grep -F` loop over the register).

### A2, A3, A4, A5 — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/check_paper_v2.py`, run 5 of the record at 13:57:35 UTC; `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/A2_A5_A10_check_paper.log`:
```
A2: 0 unanswered, 0 extra
A3: passages quoted 85
A3: 0 not found, 0 wrong line
A4: questions short of 2 positions, 4 rows (a)-(d) or 1 recommendation: 0
A5: lines closing G-14 with the brief's line 13 quoted: 1
A5: sections headed G-14: 0
decision wording ('the registry will', 'we decide', 'is decided'): 0
```
A4, per question (positions, rows, recommendations): G-01, G-03, G-05 `3 4 1`; the other ten `2 4 1`. Every row reads at least 2, 4 and 1. The program is version 1's `check_paper.py` with A10 added; version 1 showed it catches each planted fault (`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps/_evidence/A2_A5_planted.log`). A5's word screen now finds no hit in any recommendation. By reading: no recommendation matches on anything but the three fields, capitals ignored. G-05 keeps the record of sameness out of all the search reads. G-02 enters nothing new in either position.

### A6 — brief and register unchanged — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/A6_checksums.log`, 13:58:43 UTC: `ec6971e7…1f64` and `ad583b39…f103`, the declaration's two, `exit=0`. The record agrees (`record/RECORD.txt`, section 2).

### A7 — placement and trace checks — met, see §2a

### A8 — the record's check — see §2a

### A9 — the hand row — met at closing

Taken up at 31 Oct 2026, 13:48 UTC, before `round_record.py start` (13:51:48 UTC), as version 1 did. It is closed into the Closed table after this report and the record's check.

### A10 — every register line naming a gap quoted in its section — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/register_lines.py` (run 2) lists them into `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/REGISTER_LINES.md`: `Gap-line pairs: 13; distinct lines: 12 (40, 53, 80, 91, 133, 159, 185, 227, 238, 264, 305, 319)`, the review's set, established here by program. `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/A2_A5_A10_check_paper.log`: each of G-01 to G-13 `quoted` (91 in both G-01 and G-03), `A10: 0 unquoted`. A further scan in the same log: every "register line N" a section relies on is quoted in that section, `G1: 0 register lines relied on and unquoted`, and every bare "line N" of the brief is quoted somewhere in the paper, `0`.

### A11 — the settings each position relies on, none credited to one alone — met

Program `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/cells_diff.py` (run 6) rebuilds version 1 from its planted copy. Its sha256 equals the declared `d52fd3fc…11bb`. It then lists every cell changed, with its line: `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/A11_A12_cells_diff.log`, `table cells changed in all: 79, in 13 sections`. Most of the 79 are quotation fixes (G1). Below, per question, is what every position's cells rely on and the cells changed under G2 and G3. For each question I read every cell against the "Given" line and against the other sections: no setting, count or screen is credited to one position while it is open to another.

| Q | Given to every position (paper line) | G2 cells changed (a fact granted elsewhere, or a weak form) | G3 cells changed (a setting given to all) |
|---|---|---|---|
| G-01 | number given by the registry; fixed reset order; fixed seed; no check digit (58) | C (a), (c), (d) at 68, 70, 71 — seeded, same after every reset | — (check digit given to none, 58) |
| G-02 | added only on none; data setting 3; case met 0 times; one view that is a screen (89) | — | all 8 cells at 97–100 |
| G-03 | line 13 only; G-04/G-05 settings, 68 entries (118) | — | A (a), C (a) at 128; A (c), C (c) at 130 (68 entries; "no screen… added") |
| G-04 | each of the 8 on two lists (147) | — | A (c), B (c) at 157; A (d), B (d) at 158 (B: 52 children) |
| G-05 | settings 1 to 4 (181) | — | B (a), B (c), C (c) at 191, 193; B (d) at 194 (B cut back to a key on entries) |
| G-06 | completed years; 6 and 12 in; fixed dates of birth (211) | B (a), (c), (d) at 219, 221, 222 — a span, no remaking | — |
| G-07 | school not searched; empty-entry message; messages are screens; dates read one way (241) | B (c) at 251 — after reset the data's schools are 3 under both (register line 146) | A (a), B (a) at 249 — a refusal of dates under both |
| G-08 | reset by command for the checks; learner shown as outcome (268) | — | — |
| G-09 | no dialog apart from a page; same messages under both (295) | B (b), (d) at 304, 306 — no dialog reading (review item 3) | A (a), B (a) at 303 |
| G-10 | the maker's statement; the screens' words (325) | — | B (a) at 333 (statement open to both) |
| G-11 | same lists; simulations on the computer (352) | — | — |
| G-12 | checks as programs; round 3's list; either may name the register's tests (385) | — | — |
| G-13 | count read by a program (411) | — | — |

**G2:** 9 cells in 4 sections (G-01, G-06, G-07, G-09). **G3:** 23 cells in 6 sections (G-02, G-03, G-04, G-05, G-07, G-09 as above, and G-10). The remaining cells of the 79 are G1 quotations and wording.

### A12 — the first review answered gap by gap — met

| Gap | What changed | Where in the new paper |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Every gap-naming register line is quoted (A10). The restated tests are now quoted: R-16 (226, 227) in G-10's position A, table and ground; R-19 and R-18 (264, 266, 253) in G-11; the must-not and known-numbers sections in G-12. A header line says "register line N" refers to a register quotation | paper:5; register quotations at 51–54, 85, 114–116, 144–145, 172–175, 206–207, 235–237, 265–266, 291–293, 320–321, 348–350, 376–381, 408–409; G-10 327, 334, 339; G-11 354, 361, 363, 365–366; G-12 383, 394–395 |
| G2 | G-01 C restated (64) and judged again (68–71); ground rewritten (74). Rule applied to all: G-06, G-07, G-09 cells (A11) | paper:64, 68–71, 74, 215, 219–222, 251, 299, 304, 306 |
| G3 | G-02 cut back to refuse vs show all, with the data setting and the view given to both (89); rule applied to all (A11) | paper:89, 91, 93, 97–100, 103 |
| item 2 | G-04: two-lists setting given to both; B gets 52 children and 60 entries | paper:147, 157, 158 |
| item 4 | G-12 A (b) names R-16 to R-21, the section from register line 214 to 294 | paper:378–379, 383, 394 |
| item 5 | G-05 states the conflict, quoting register 172 and 79, and resolves it by setting 2 (no capitals-only children) | paper:172–175, 179, 181, 196 |

### §2a — A7 and A8

**A7 — met.** Both run at 14:00:04 UTC under `/usr/bin/python3`, after this report's first write. `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/A7_placement_check.log`: `placement check: clean` · `exit=0`. `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/A7_trace_check.log`: `agrees: the instruction's downstream_artefact is this report` · `outputs: 3 of 3 named exist` · `trace check: clean` · `exit=0`.

**A8.** `/usr/bin/python3 -B round_record.py check --record ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/record --report <this report> --out ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/record/check.out`. It is the round's last act before the row is closed, after the `window` line, and its exit is quoted in the closed row. `round_record.py end` ran at 13:58:43 UTC. Files written after the end list and named here: this report, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/A7_placement_check.log`, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/A7_trace_check.log`, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/ls_outputs.log`, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/record/window.out`, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/record/check.out`, and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` (its row closed).

**Places written, `ls -ld`** (`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/ls_outputs.log`, 14:00 UTC; the report and the row as they stood before the last writes): `docs/GAPS-PAPER.md`, the evidence folder, this report and `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`, each `exit=0`. Nothing was opened on the owner's screen.

## 3. Found, not fixed

- Test (a)'s gloss counts any added screen against a position (instruction, section 7). The refusal views of G-02 and G-07 are screens under G-09's recommendation, so every position of those two questions adds one. The paper records this in the rows ("the test does not divide them"). Round 3 may want to say which refusals the goal carries.
- Under G-03 B, line 7's "does not register the same child twice" is broken at reset for the 4 the rule misses. The paper states this in G-03 B (a), as what round 7 counts. The Permanent Secretary's note (round 8) may need to say it.
- G-14 stays open in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md:341`, as version 1 noted.
- `round_record.py` reports the paper as "written by no traced run". It was written by Desktop Commander's file tool, which the record cannot trace.

## 4. What I could not establish

- That no cell credits a setting to one position alone rests on a reading, cell by cell. The programs list the cells and their lines; they cannot judge meaning.
- 64, 68 and 4 of 8 are worked out by a toy data set (`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/figures.py`), not by round 5's data.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

- As in version 1: the row was taken before `start`. The `window` line is read by `date -u` and `stat`, because `round_record.py window` needs a `started` entry and there is none. The model is `claude-opus-5-5`, an Opus model.
- A1 to A9 are read with version 2's paths. A7's trace check runs over this report, `_reports/REPORT_GAPS_2026-10-31_v2.md`. A8's check runs over `round-01b-gaps-v2/_evidence/record`.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing of the task. The owner's ruling is his. The review follows, started by this session as a sub-agent.
