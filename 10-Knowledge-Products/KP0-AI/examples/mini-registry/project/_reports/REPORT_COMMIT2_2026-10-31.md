# ACCOUNT — Commit the day's files in the mini registry's repository and in the coordination's, with no push

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_COMMIT2_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-15`) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`, proved by `date -u; hostname`, which printed `Sat Oct 31 17:46:03 UTC 2026` and `MacBookPro`

## 1. The answer first

Both repositories hold one new commit each, made with `git add -A` and the identity git was configured with (Arne Laponin <(account removed)>, none set), and nothing was pushed or added as a remote. The mini registry: `c419cf3` over `2fad722`, 201 files (196 added, 5 modified, 0 deleted), 27231 insertions, 12 deletions. The coordination: `42cfa12` over `2ba3804`, 52 files (all added: 15 guards and 37 ledger entries, this task's `started` entry among them). Straight after the two commits both `git status --porcelain` printed nothing, and `ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` prints nothing in either. The ignored files (`.DS_Store`; `WHO.html`, `MEASURES.md`) stayed out. Open block read after the started entry: no task but this one was running; C-2026-10-31-16, -17 and -18 stood issued and waiting.

## 2. The criteria, one by one

**A1 — status clean straight after the commits.** Run at 17:47:03 UTC in the same act as the commits, its output held in `/tmp` and copied into the evidence folder only after both status reads, so nothing was written into either repository between the commits and A1. Met.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2/_evidence/commit_and_A1.txt`:

```text
# 2026-10-31 17:47:03 UTC A1 status straight after
## mini-registry
# exit=0
## _coordination
# exit=0
```

Both outputs are empty: no line stands between a repository's heading and its `# exit=0`.

**A2 — one new commit in each, no remote.** `git log --oneline -3` and `git remote -v` at 17:47:13 UTC, kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2/_evidence/after_mini-registry.txt` and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2/_evidence/after__coordination.txt`. The mini registry's log shows `c419cf3` over `2fad722` over `74ca995`; the coordination's shows `42cfa12` over `2ba3804` over `f30bc04`. Under `## git remote -v` nothing is printed in either, `# exit=0`. Met.

**A3 — nothing ignored committed.** `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` at 17:47:13 UTC, in the same two after-files: nothing printed, exit 0, in both. Met.

**A4 — files committed equal to the new and changed lines of the before status.** The before status of section 3 step 1 (`--porcelain --ignored`, `before_mini-registry.txt`, `before__coordination.txt`) collapses each untracked folder into one line, so in the mini registry its line count cannot equal the files committed; the round also took a file-level listing (`-uall`, `before_uall_*.txt`) just before `git add -A` and reconciled the two. Counts read by `grep -c` and `show --name-only | grep -c .`, kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2/_evidence/A4_reconcile.txt`:

| Repository | New and changed lines of the before status (folders collapsed) | Lines of the `-uall` listing | Files in `git show --stat HEAD` |
|---|---|---|---|
| mini-registry | 42 (5 modified, 37 untracked, 10 of them folders) | 200 | 201 |
| _coordination | 52 | 52 | 52 |

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2/_evidence/A4_reconcile.txt`:

```text
files in HEAD not in -uall listing:
_working/round-commit2/_evidence/before_uall__coordination.txt
files in -uall listing not in HEAD:
```

The one file of difference in the mini registry is the round's own evidence file `before_uall__coordination.txt`, written after the mini registry's `-uall` listing and before its commit. The five modified files (`WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`, `_kinds/analysis.md`, `_kinds/drafting.md`, `_prompts/PROMPT_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md`, `_prompts/PROMPT_REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md`) were changed by earlier rounds of the day and by the ledger's rebuild of `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` on this round's started entry; this round edited no file's content. In the coordination the equality holds exactly, 52 = 52. In the mini registry: every file listed new or changed before is committed and nothing else is but the round's own evidence; the literal equality of the collapsed count (42) with 201 does not hold, and section 5 says why. Met at the level of files, not as literally written.

**A5 — trace check over this report.** Run after this report is written; its output is kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2/_evidence/trace_check.out`. The exit is recorded there and in the `finished` entry's outcome.

**A6 — started and finished entries in the ledger.** The started entry `20261031T174610Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-15.yaml` stands and is committed in `42cfa12`. The finished entry is written after this report; `ledger.py show` is then run and kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2/_evidence/ledger_show.out`.

## 3. Found, not fixed

- `repo-hygiene` commits for a `local` project only the files a session can name as its own, never `git add -A`; this instruction orders `git add -A` at the owner's word. The round followed the instruction, as the first commit of the day did.
- The before status of section 3 step 1 (`--porcelain --ignored`) collapses untracked folders, so A4 again compares unlike counts; the same finding stood in the first commit of the day's report and the instruction was not changed for it.

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing beyond A5 and A6, which are settled only after this report is written, by the logs named under them.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

- A4 as written cannot hold whenever an untracked folder is listed as one line; the round answered it with the `-uall` listing as well, and gives both counts above.
- The instruction names Sonnet; the session ran on claude-opus-5-5, the scheduled task's model.
- The evidence folder lies inside the mini registry, so the round's before-evidence (`before_mini-registry.txt`, `before__coordination.txt`, `before_uall_mini-registry.txt`, `before_uall__coordination.txt`) was written before the commit and is committed in `c419cf3`.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Standing uncommitted after the commit, as the instruction expects: in the mini registry, `_working/round-commit2/_evidence/commit_and_A1.txt`, `after_mini-registry.txt`, `after__coordination.txt`, `A4_reconcile.txt`, `ls_outputs.txt`, `window.out`, `trace_check.out`, `ledger_show.out`, this report and `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` as rebuilt by the finished entry; in the coordination, this task's `finished` entry and any guard records written by the checks after 17:47:03 UTC. No second commit was made to chase them.

## 7. The outputs, by path

The listing is kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2/_evidence/ls_outputs.txt`, taken by `ls -ld` of each place with its exit code.
