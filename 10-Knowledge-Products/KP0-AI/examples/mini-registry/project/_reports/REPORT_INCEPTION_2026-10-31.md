# ACCOUNT — The inception of the mini registry

**Answers:** the owner's direct request · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander

## 1. The answer first

The mini registry is set up at `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry` and ready for round 1 of the brief (the register of requirements). The three places for instructions, reports and reviews are made. So is every folder on the map the owner ruled on, each with a note, and the record of what is running. The constants are written from his answers, with code `MR`. The four pages of the kinds of work are copied into `_kinds/`. A new coordination is made at `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination`, with this project as its first estate. The history is kept on this computer only: the repository is made at the project's root with its first commit, and there is no remote, by the owner's choice.

## 2. What was asked, one by one

| Asked | How it was answered | Met |
|---|---|---|
| The self-test of the programs | `test_inception.py`: "122 of 122 passed.", exit 0 | met |
| The look | `inception.py look`: "a new project. Nothing is there to be written over.", exit 0 | met |
| The questions | Three forms. Purpose, deliverables, governing documents, recipients, constraints, kinds of thing and code: each the recommended answer. History: **on this computer only** (not the recommended backup). Coordination: **a new `_coordination` in wai-demo** (not the recommended `[another coordination]`). Procedure read from: **the installed plugin's folder** (not the recommended `orchestrator-local`) | met |
| The map ruled on | "The map as proposed", the owner's choice on the question form | met |
| Everything made | `inception.py create`, exit 0: 11 places made, nothing already there | met |
| The kinds pages copied | `cp -n` of `analysis.md`, `building.md`, `checking.md` and `drafting.md` from `../kinds/` into `_kinds/` | met |
| The constants | `inception.py constants`, exit 0: "It carries no dated fact outside section 2 that the check can find, and no unfilled part of the form." Read by hand against the form's test as well: no count or state found | met |
| Commit, and no push | follows this report in the same run, by `inception.py publish` with `version_control: local` | follows |

## 3. Found, not fixed

- The new coordination's table of computers carries `MacBookPro` alone. The coordination at `~/Documents/Dev/[another coordination]` also carries `[the other name of the computer]`, the other name `hostname` reports for the same Mac. A round that runs while the Mac reports that name will not match the table.
- The new coordination at `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination` sits outside this project's repository and is under no version control of its own. Its constants say the ledger is kept by git `no`.
- Section 6 of the constants names the installed plugin's folder under Claude Desktop's Application Support. The constants already say how to correct it if the folder moves.
- The brief that governs the project, `../brief/MINI-REGISTRY-BRIEF.md`, sits outside this repository, so its versions are not in the project's history.

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing that was asked.

## 5. Corrections to the record

The row opened in `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` by the program names the files the round would write. It does not name three things the round also wrote: the four pages copied into `_kinds/`, and the coordination's `CONSTANTS.md`. It also says the commit is pushed, but no remote was chosen. The closing row records all three.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing. The next round is round 1 of the brief, the register of requirements, commissioned by the project's first orchestrator (`MR · orchestrator`). That orchestrator writes its `taken-up` entry in the new coordination's ledger, and cuts this record over by section 9.1 of the procedure.

## 7. The outputs, by path

The root is `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry`. Size in bytes and the first 12 characters of the sha256, by `stat -f %z` and `shasum -a 256`, read before this report was written:

| `_kinds/README.md` | 548 | `bf58daf76d35` |

`.gitignore` and the repository, `.git/`, are made by `publish` after this report, and the final check, `inception.py verify`, lists them.
