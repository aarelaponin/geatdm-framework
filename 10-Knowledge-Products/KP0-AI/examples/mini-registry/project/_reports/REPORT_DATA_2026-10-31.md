# ACCOUNT — Build the prototype's scaffold in Node.js and the reset that makes the made-up data in the known numbers, with a check for every number

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_DATA_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-21`) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`

## 1. The answer first

The scaffold stands under `src/` in Node.js with no dependencies: a seeded generator (seed 20261031), invented name parts written in the source, the generator of the three lists and the key table, the search rule as one module (`lib/search.js`, three fields, capitals ignored, nothing else, given the learners only), and `reset.js`, which writes 8 JSON files under `data/`. `node reset.js` exits 0 and `node --test test/` passes 29 checks of 29, each counting the files the reset wrote: 60 children, 3 schools of 20, 68 entries as 24, 22 and 22, 8 children on two lists in Q-5's pairs, 4 of them spelt differently on the later list, every age 6 to 12 on 2026-10-31, 64 learners numbered 1 to 64, 68 rows in the record of entries. The planted fault (one child dropped, in a scratch copy) fails 7 checks by name; the reset made twice gives identical `data/`; nothing in `src/` connects or opens; the reset reads only files under `src/`; the 15 sources are unchanged. The 64 is reached because the rule misses the 4 differently spelt children, not by any widening of the search.

## 2. The criteria, one by one

### A1 — Stage 1's four outputs, before any write — met

Run at 18:51:33 UTC, after the record's start list (18:51:23 UTC) and before any file under `src/` was written (the first, `package.json`, at 18:52:54 UTC by `RECORD.txt`).

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-05-data/_evidence/A1_stage1.log`:

```
$ node --version
v20.5.1
exit 0
$ npm --version
10.9.2
exit 0
$ node -e "require('node:test')"
exit 0
```

and `ls -la` of `src/` showed `README.md` alone (same log, exit 0).

### A2 — the reset exits 0, and every check passes — met

Both ran through `run` (record runs 1 and 2).

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-05-data/_evidence/A2_reset_and_checks.log`:

```
# tests 29
# suites 0
# pass 29
# fail 0
```

The reset's own line before the checks reads `exit 0`, and the checks end `exit 0`. The 29 checks by name are in the log: 18 over the data (`test/data.test.js`), 3 over the reset (`test/reset.test.js`: made twice byte for byte the same; `data/` equal to what the reset makes; the record of reads), 8 over the search rule (`test/search.test.js`). Every check of the data reads `data/*.json` through `lib/data_files.js`, a reader that imports nothing from the modules that made the data; each expected number is written in the check from the source it names.

| Number or rule the instruction names | Check (number in the log) |
|---|---|
| 60 children | 2 |
| 3 schools, 20 each (Q-7) | 3, 5 |
| 68 entries, 24, 22, 22 (Q-6) | 6 |
| every date YYYY-MM-DD (Q-10) | 8 |
| every age 6 to 12 on 2026-10-31 (Q-1) | 9 |
| every entry carries a school (Q-9) | 4 |
| 8 on exactly two lists, pairs of Q-5 | 10 |
| 4 spelt differently, on the later list (Q-5) | 11, 13 |
| the rest matching as Q-8 says | 12 |
| no two children share the three fields, capitals ignored (Q-14) | 14 |
| the key table's 68 rows, named as Q-11 gives | 15, 7 |
| 64 learners, numbered 1 to 64 (Q-13, Q-4) | 16 |
| the record of entries, 68 rows (Q-12) | 17, 18 |
| the reset twice, byte for byte | 19, 20 |
| the search compares its three fields, capitals ignored | 22 to 26, 29 |

15 rows, the 15 items of section 3's list of checks.

### A3 — the planted fault — met

In a scratch copy at `_working/round-05-data/_evidence/A3_planted/src`, one line added to `lib/lists.js` drops the last census-only child before the lists are numbered; the reset and the checks run there (record runs 3 and 4).

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-05-data/_evidence/A3_planted_fault.log`:

```
not ok 2 - R-09, G-04: 60 different children, named C01 to C60 (Q-11)
```

and with it `not ok` 5, 6, 15, 16, 17 and 18, ending `# fail 7` and `exit 1`. The real `src/lib/lists.js` keeps sha256 `28672ec0926001c9068b75af51e5e7be823ef61ebeb8761001d67674b24dff14`, the value on the `outputs` line.

### A4 — the reset the same every time — met

`node reset.js` twice (record runs 5 and 6), `shasum -a 256 data/*` after each into `A4_first.sha256` and `A4_second.sha256`, both 704 bytes and both sha256 `31feb778e9950b9886aaa300c2ca45d10a08801537183b3cf5f2d9985d1d2c56` by the record's `RECORD.txt`. The diff of the two, in

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-05-data/_evidence/A4_reset_twice.log`:

```
exit 0  (0: identical)
```

### A5 — nothing connects and nothing opens — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-05-data/_evidence/A5_nothing_connects.log`: `grep -rnE` for `fetch`, `http`, `https`, `net` as a word, `dgram`, `child_process` and `open(` over every `.js`, `.json` and `.md` file of `src/`, `data/` included, and a second grep for `net` as any substring over every file: both print nothing and end `exit 1  (1: no occurrence)`. `package.json` has no `dependencies` key (`grep -c` prints 0), and there is no `node_modules` or `package-lock.json`. Nothing in the round opened a window: every command ran in the shell, the checks with `node:test`.

### A6 — the reset's record of its reads — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-05-data/_evidence/A6_reads.log` quotes `src/data/reads.json`: five files, `lib/lists.js`, `lib/names.js`, `lib/random.js`, `lib/search.js` and `reset.js`, each `"under_src": true`. The reset finds them from the module tree Node keeps for it; it reads no file by `fs`. Check 21 holds it.

### A7 — the sources unchanged — met

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-05-data/_evidence/A7_sources_unchanged.log`:

```
exit 0  (0: all 15 unchanged)
```

The 15 files are listed with their sha256 in `sources_sha256_start.txt` (18:51:34 UTC) and `sources_sha256_end.txt` (18:56:45 UTC): the brief, the register, the groundwork and its three CSVs, the two papers, the count, the ruling D-2026-10-31-09, the building page, the constants, the procedure, the report form and this instruction.

### A8 — the placement and trace checks — met

Both run outside `run`, after this report was first written; both print `clean` and exit 0. They are run again, outside `run`, after the report's last write, with the record check, and their output kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-05-data/_evidence/record/A8_checks.log`. The trace check reads `outputs: 7 of 7 named exist` and `inputs: 9 of 9 pinned by 20261031T184747Z_MR_issued_C-2026-10-31-21.yaml hash the same now`.

### A9 — the record check

Run as the round's last act before the `finished` entry, with this report; its output is `record/check.out`. Its exit is given in the `finished` entry's outcome. The `end` list itself found 0 findings (`RECORD.txt`, section 4).

### A10 — the ledger entries

Read with `ledger.py show` after the `finished` entry, into `record/A10_ledger_show.log`; the review reads them there.

## 3. Found, not fixed

- The data alone cannot say which of a child's two spellings is "the" different one: both differ from each other. Check 13 holds the consequence Q-5 fixes instead — the earlier list's spelling is the first learner's, the later list's makes a second, higher-numbered learner. Round 7 reads the 4 the same way. (`src/test/data.test.js`)
- `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`'s Open block names this round's outputs under `~/IdeaProjects/mini-registry/`, a path that does not exist on this Mac (`ls ~/IdeaProjects`: no such file); the instruction's paths under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/` were used. (`WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`, produced by `ledger.py views`)
- `src/data/schools.json` (the 3 schools, for round 6's choice of school, ruling G-07) is not named among the instruction's examples; it is written by the reset like every other file under `data/`.

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing the instruction asks.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

None. The round ran on the model the instruction names.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing. Round 6 builds the screens on `lib/search.js` as it stands and on `data/learners.json`; round 7 counts the 8 from `data/key_table.json` and `data/enrolments.json`.

## 7. The outputs, by path

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-05-data/_evidence/ls_places.log` (18:56:54 UTC) holds `ls -ld` of `src/`, `src/lib/`, `src/data/`, `src/test/`, `src/package.json`, `src/reset.js`, the evidence folder and `_reports/`, each `exit 0`. The 18 files under `src/` with their sizes and sha256 are on the `outputs` line and in `_working/round-05-data/_evidence/outputs_src.txt`; `src/README.md` was there before the round and is untouched.
