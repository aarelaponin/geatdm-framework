# ACCOUNT — Write the groundwork of the mini registry: the settings, the lists and the search rule, as tables the build reads, every row traced to its source (version 2)

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_GROUNDWORK_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-07`, version 2) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`, every program with `/usr/bin/python3` (3.9.6)

## 1. The answer first

Version 2 closes the review's gap G1. The groundwork was not redone: the three CSVs are unchanged, byte for byte, and `GROUNDWORK.md` changed by one added line, gap 14, "Capitals in \"share\"". It quotes the ruling on G-05 ("no two different children share all three fields") and the brief's line 13, and is left open as a question. The round's own checks of A2, A3 and A4 were run again through `round_record.py run` and print what they printed for version 1, with A4 still `0 uncovered`. The layer's placement and trace checks were run outside `run`, so the record holds only the round's own programs: 3 runs, 7 files read, all on the start list, and 0 findings at `end`. B1 to B6 are met; A9 is established by the review, after the `finished` entry.

## 2. The criteria, one by one

### B1 — the CSVs unchanged, `GROUNDWORK.md` the one file changed, by gap 14 alone — met

`before.sha256` was taken at 14:54:03 UTC, before `start`, and `after.sha256` at 14:55:27 UTC, after `end`. Their diff, log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/B1_B6_sha.out`:

```
< f2284affe810c2886d8a1899681e3d16af96a547dea10f7acc6bcbfca2584df9  docs/GROUNDWORK.md

> 5ed9b62f282d433df7c337a2da30e4830c56170dca1e646ae5aacc2cc2795dce  docs/GROUNDWORK.md
```

The only other lines that differ are the two dates. The copy of version 1's `GROUNDWORK.md` was taken just after `start` (`GROUNDWORK_v1.md`, sha256 `f2284aff…84df9`, the same as `before.sha256`). Its diff against the file as it now stands, log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/B1_B2_diff.out`, has a single hunk: `55a56`, one line added, gap 14. `RECORD.txt` section 1 lists `GROUNDWORK.md` as the one changed file outside the evidence folder.

### B2 — gap 14 is a question quoting the ruled words and line 13, and answers nothing — met

Gap 14 quotes the G-05 recommendation's words "no two different children share all three fields". It also quotes the brief's line 13, "the same family name, given names and date of birth (capitals ignored)", and the G-03 recommendation's "through the brief's own rule". It ends by asking which of two readings holds, and it chooses neither. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/B1_B2_diff.out`:

```
$ grep -c "^[0-9][0-9]*\. \*\*" docs/GROUNDWORK.md (numbered gaps)
14
$ grep "^14\. " docs/GROUNDWORK.md | grep -c "?$" (gap 14 ends in a question mark)
1
```

The same log finds the ruled words at the paper's line 196, the G-05 recommendation. It also finds line 13's words in the brief, once. No table changed (B1), so no table answers the question.

### B3 — the round's checks of A2, A3 and A4 print what they printed for version 1 — met

Each ran through `round_record.py run` from version 1's evidence folder, against the files as they now stand (`A2_check.out`, `A3_check.out`, `A4_check.out` in this round's evidence folder, 14:54:45 to 14:54:46 UTC). Their output, less each log's two header lines, was compared with version 1's logs. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/B3_compare.out`:

```
$ diff <(tail -n +3 v1/A2_check.out) <(tail -n +3 v2/A2_check.out)
EXIT=0
$ diff <(tail -n +3 v1/A3_check.out) <(tail -n +3 v2/A3_check.out)
EXIT=0
$ diff <(tail -n +3 v1/A4_check.out) <(tail -n +3 v2/A4_check.out)
EXIT=0
```

The lines that decide them, log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/A4_check.out`:

```
  R-02: named in GROUNDWORK.md
0 uncovered
EXIT=0
```

A2 prints `0 without source, 0 unresolved` over 17, 16 and 17 rows. A3 prints `compared fields: 3; forgiven: 1; school compared: no; key table read: no; failures: 0`. Both exit 0.

### B4 — the placement and trace checks, outside `run`, exit 0 — met

The placement check's first run, at 14:55:18 UTC, came before this report existed. It exited 1 on one finding, this report missing (`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/B4_placement.out`). Its run once this report was written, log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/B4_placement_2.out`:

```
placement check: clean
EXIT=0
```

The trace check over this report, log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/B4_trace.out`:

```
trace check: clean
EXIT=0
```

Neither ran through `round_record.py run`. `RECORD.txt` section 3 lists 3 runs, all `check_groundwork.py`.

### B5 — the record check exits 0 — met

`RECORD.txt` (`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/record/RECORD.txt`): `start list: 226 files; end list: 233 files; runs traced: 3`, 7 files read, each `on the start list · yes`, and `## 4. Findings — 0`. The check of step 8 is the round's last act before its `finished` entry, and its output stands in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/record/check.out`.

**Written after `end`**, and so not on the record's lists: in the evidence folder, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/end.out`, `B4_placement.out`, `B4_placement_2.out`, `B4_trace.out`, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/after.sha256`, `B1_B6_sha.out` and `ls_ld.out`; in the record's folder, `window.out` and `check.out`; and this report.

### B6 — the three sources unchanged — met

Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/B1_B6_sha.out`:

```
ec6971e74a6a8387de0e5bd7a5e1cdead6ddf711b8fdac3ccc1d4b7555e11f64  brief/MINI-REGISTRY-BRIEF.md

```

These are the three checksums of the instruction's section 2. `RECORD.txt` section 2 gives the brief and the register the same checksum at the start and at the end.

### A9 — the ledger entries — not established in this report

The `started` entry stands: `20261031T145311Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-07.yaml`, exit 0, 14:53:11 UTC, account `(account removed)`, effort `unknown`, started-by `unknown`. The `finished` entry is written after this report, so the review runs `show`.

## 3. Found, not fixed

- The Open block of `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` still gives this task's and the review's files as `~/IdeaProjects/mini-registry/…`, while the estate's root is `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry`. The review of version 1 notes the same.
- Version 1's evidence folder keeps the record of version 1, and its `check.out` exits 1; it is left as written.

## 4. What I could not establish

- A9 for the `finished` entry: it is written after this report.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

- The trace check of A7 names version 1's report, `REPORT_GROUNDWORK_2026-10-31.md`. Version 2's step 6 has it run over this version's report, which is the one this round writes, so it was run over `REPORT_GROUNDWORK_2026-10-31_v2.md`.
- Step 1 records `before.sha256` before the record's `start` of step 2, so that write is not on the record's lists. It was done in the order the instruction gives.
- The session runs on claude-opus-5-5, the band the instruction names. The effort is written `unknown`, as section 1 requires for a scheduled start.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing of version 2 is left. The 14 gaps of `GROUNDWORK.md` are left open for the owner's ruling.

## 7. The outputs, by path

Each place the round wrote in, listed at 14:55:34 UTC. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/ls_ld.out`:

```
drwxr-xr-x@ 7 owner  staff  224 Oct 31 16:54 ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs
exit 0
drwxr-xr-x@ 8 owner  staff  256 Oct 31 16:55 ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-02-groundwork-v2/_evidence/record
exit 0
drwxr-xr-x@ 9 owner  staff  288 Oct 31 16:40 ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports
exit 0
```

The evidence folder itself is listed in the same log, exit 0. Nothing was opened on the owner's screen, and nothing was committed.
