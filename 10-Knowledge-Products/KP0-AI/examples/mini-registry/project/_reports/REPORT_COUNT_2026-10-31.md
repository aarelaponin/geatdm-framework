# ACCOUNT — Count every requirement against the goal, both ways, and report each total with its evidence

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_COUNT_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-19`) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`, programs under `/usr/bin/python3` 3.9.6

## 1. The answer first

Requirements → goal: 13 of the 23 requirements reach at least one element of the goal and 10 reach none (R-08 to R-13 and R-16, the made-up data; R-19 and R-21, what the prototype must not do outside the goal; R-23, the delivery). Goal → requirements: 12 of the 19 elements are reached by at least one requirement and 7 by none — every way the goal goes wrong, F-1 to F-7. The count is 72 rows of `docs/count/count.csv` (62 pairs, 10 `none`), every ground words of its requirement's test, and `docs/COUNT.md` carries the totals and the names. What changes the picture: no requirement's test passes through any failure of the goal, so round 6 builds F-1 to F-7, and their checks under the ruling on G-12, with no requirement test behind any of them; and every screen is reached only because R-17 shows "each screen in turn" — SC-4 and SC-5 are reached by R-17 alone.

**The rule the pairs were read by.** An element is paired where the test's own acts, done on the goal as ruled, pass through it or end at it, and the ground quotes those acts. So an enrolment the test makes passes S-2, S-3 (under the ruling on Q-7 every entry that reaches the search has passed S-3) and S-4, then S-5 or S-6 where the test says whether the child is held; S-1 and SC-1 only where the test opens or reads the enrolment screen (R-02, R-03, R-17); a screen only where the test reads it. Not paired, and why: R-01 "as a school clerk" names no screen; R-06 (b) enters F-5's trigger, a family name one letter off, but its test does not say the child is the one already held, and expects a new learner as right; R-05 (a) enters the three fields of a learner held, but does not say the child is a different one, which F-7 needs; R-05 names more than one found only as gap G-02; R-18 and R-22 run "the prototype's checks", which by the ruling on G-12 include one check per failure, but the tests name no failure; R-14, R-15 and R-20 enrol "one child" / "a child" without saying whether it is held, so neither S-5 nor S-6 is paired. The goal's own citation columns were not read to make a pair.

## 2. The criteria, one by one

**A1 — the sets listed first.** Run at 18:27:56 UTC through `run`: `list_sets.py` writes `REQUIREMENTS_SET.txt` from every `### R-nn` heading of the register and `GOAL_SET.txt` from every `### S-`, `### F-`, `### SC-` heading of `GOAL.md` and the "**Added:**" line of "Taken together" (F-6, F-7), then reads each line back at the place it names. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A1.log`:

```
REQUIREMENTS_SET.txt: 23 lines, 23 distinct, 0 not found at its place
GOAL_SET.txt: 19 lines, 19 distinct, 0 not found at its place
      23 REQUIREMENTS_SET.txt
      19 GOAL_SET.txt
```

F-6 and F-7 are at `docs/GOAL-QUESTIONS-PAPER.md:313`; the other 17 at their headings in `docs/GOAL.md`. **Met.**

**A2 — every row names members of the sets, every requirement present.** `count.py` on the real CSV, 18:29:48 UTC, log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A2_A5_count.log`:

```
rows read: 72 (~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/count/count.csv)
0 unknown, 0 absent
```

The program also names any requirement written both with `none` and with elements, and any pair written twice; it named none. **Met.**

**A3 — every ground is words of its requirement's test.** `check_grounds.py`, 18:29:48 UTC: the test of R-nn is the lines from "**Test.**" under its heading to the next heading; each ground is looked for in them; for a `none` row the ground is "<why>: <words>", the why one of the three the instruction names, and the words after the first ": " are looked for. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A3.log`, one line per row with the register line it was found at, ending:

```
72 rows, 23 tests read, 0 not found
```

**Met.**

**A4 — the planted fault, before the real run.** `plant.py` copied `count.csv` to `planted.csv`, removing the pair R-17,SC-4 — the only pair reaching SC-4 — and adding R-24,S-1; `count.py` ran on the copy at 18:29:47 UTC, before its run on the real file at 18:29:48 UTC. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A4.log`:

```
removed: R-17,SC-4,"show each screen in turn"
added:   R-24,S-1,"open the enrolment screen"
unknown row: R-24,S-1
1 unknown, 0 absent
  SC-4 <- none
reached by at least one requirement: 11
reached by none: 8
```

SC-4, reached in the real count, is named unreached, and R-24 is named unknown. A first try at 18:29:26 UTC caught both as well but printed no `GOAL.md` source for a screen, because screens carry "Named by" and not "Source"; `count.py` was corrected and the plant run again. That try's log is `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A4_first_try.log`. **Met.**

**A5 — the totals printed by the program are those of COUNT.md, every unreached member named.** Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A5.log`:

```
reach at least one element: 13
reach none: 10
reached by at least one requirement: 12
reached by none: 7
| requirements → goal | 13 | 10 | 23 |
| goal → requirements | 12 | 7 | 19 |
```

The same log lists the 10 requirements and 7 elements the program names unreached, then the 17 rows of `COUNT.md`'s two tables: the same names in the same order. Each requirement's ground in `COUNT.md` is the ground of its `none` row; each element's source is the `Source` line of `GOAL.md` and its "Taken together" row, or the "**Added:**" line, as `count.py` printed them. **Met.**

**A6 — the register, the goal and the paper unchanged.** 18:30:24 UTC, log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A6.log`:

```
ad583b3958fb5c5fdf6683b5c2487b6f0c425d66cebc7c46811e2e19af13f103  docs/REQUIREMENTS.md

```

The checksums of section 2 of the instruction, and the record's read list gives the same at start and end. **Met.**

**A7 — placement and trace checks, outside `run`.** Run after this report was written; their logs are `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A7_placement.log` and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A7_trace.log`. The run before the report existed, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/A7_placement_before_report.log`, exits 1 on one finding only, the report missing. The runs after it are read from their logs, which keep the exit as their last line; they are not typed here, so that this report is not written again after its window.

**A8 — the record check.** Run last, before the `finished` entry, into `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-04-count/_evidence/record/check.out`, which keeps what it printed and its exit. `end` ran at 18:30:39 UTC with 0 findings, 7 runs traced, 17 files changed, 11 read.

**A9 — the ledger entries.** The `started` entry stands, `20261031T182355Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-19.yaml`, written with `--effort unknown --started-by unknown`; the `finished` entry follows this report, and `ledger.py show` is for the review to run.

## 3. Found, not fixed

- `docs/GOAL.md`'s screens carry no "Source" line, only "Named by"; the screens' sources are in the prose at `docs/GOAL.md:112` (R-17 · brief:33 · ruling:G-09).
- `docs/GOAL.md` still titles SC-4 "The date of birth refused" and S-3 "holds the date of birth to its form"; the ruling renames SC-4 "the entry refused" and widens S-3 (`docs/GOAL-QUESTIONS-PAPER.md:297`, `:310`). The goal as written and the goal as ruled differ until a round writes the ruling into `GOAL.md`.
- No requirement's test exercises a failure of the goal; R-05's and R-06's tests enter exactly the triggers of F-7 and F-5 without saying whether the child is the one already held. A candidate for a later round: tests for F-1 to F-7, or the rule by which the checks of G-12 stand for them.
- The produced Open table of `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` writes this task's paths as `~/IdeaProjects/mini-registry/…`, a folder that is not this estate's root on this computer.

## 4. What I could not establish

Whether a pair read by the rule of section 1 is the pair the orchestrator meant where a test is silent on whether the child is held (R-14, R-15, R-20; F-5 for R-06, F-7 for R-05). The rule is stated; the review's route, the goal's citations, will show where it parts from them.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

None found. The instruction's ground for a `none` row must both say why and be words of the test; the CSV writes it "<why>: <words>" and A3's program reads the words after the why.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing of the task. The review follows.
