# ACCOUNT — Amend the page of the kind of work for the three gaps of the kind item that the ledger names recurring

**Answers:** `PROMPT_KIND_ITEM_2026-10-31.md` (C-2026-10-31-27) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`; the sandbox shell `device_bash` was used only to read the estate's files

## 1. The answer first

The four gaps (three reviews; the commit review has two) are listed and quoted in `_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/GAPS.md`. The two analysis gaps belong to `_kinds/analysis.md`. The first questions review's G1 was already carried by part 1, item 7. The second questions review's G1 was carried only in part by items 3 and 7: item 7 names a dependency declared in one direction, not one declared in neither, and nothing on the page says against what a rival's buildability is tested. Part 3 had no line making the orchestrator check either before issuing. One line was added to part 3, as the instruction's section 3 directs, ending with both reviews in italics; no other line changed. The commit review's G1 and G2 came from an instruction of the kind `none`, which has no page; their cure is that instruction's version 2, quoted below, and nothing was written for them.

## 2. The criteria, one by one

### A1 — `GAPS.md` holds the four gaps, each quoted at its line; a command shows each is in its file → `0 not found`

Run at 2026-10-31 19:29:52 UTC; the program `check_gaps.py` beside the file reads each `Source:` line and checks the quotation against that one line. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/A1_gaps_check.txt`:

```text
8 quotations, 0 not found
exit=0
```

The four gaps: GA1 at `_reviews/REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md:107`, GA2 at `_reviews/REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md:99`, GC1 at `_reviews/REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md:53`, GC2 at `_reviews/REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md:54` (each with its proposed wording where the review gives one). **Met.**

### A2 — For each gap, the page line that carries it, quoted

Every quotation below is held in `_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/PAGE_LINES.md` and checked there at its line at 2026-10-31 19:30:24 UTC, after the amendment. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/A2_page_lines_check.txt`:

```text
11 quotations, 0 not found
exit=0
```

| Gap | Page | The line that carries it |
|---|---|---|
| GA1 — Q-6's rival judged without Q-5 as recommended; dependency one way | `_kinds/analysis.md` | Already there: part 1, item 7, line 14, «or to declare a dependency between two answers in one direction only.» Now also checked at issue by the line added to part 3, line 26. |
| GA2 — Q-10's rival judged on the counts alone; dependency Q-8/Q-10 declared in neither section | `_kinds/analysis.md` | In part before: item 3, line 10, «To count over a set it has not listed.», and item 7, line 14 (one direction only). Added: part 3, line 26, «listed from every proposal's words and declared both ways» and «reads it against the ruled settings and the other recommendations' words, not the counts alone.» |
| GC1 — commit A1: evidence redirected into the repository being committed | none | No page: the instruction's version 2, `_prompts/PROMPT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md:124`, «Keep every piece of evidence outside both repositories until step 5», and its test B1 at line 132. |
| GC2 — commit A4: committed set exceeds the before list by two evidence files | none | No page: the instruction's version 2, line 128, «Only then copy the folder's files into» the evidence folder, and its test B2 at line 133, «`0 missing, 0 extra`». |

The table has 4 lines for the 4 gaps of `GAPS.md`. **Met.**

### A3 — `diff` of the page before and after shows only added lines, each ending with its source reviews

The page was copied before any write at 2026-10-31 19:29:26 UTC (`00_before.txt`, sha256 `a5054bec7db8…` for both, 25 lines). The diff at 19:30:07 UTC. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/A3_diff.txt`:

```text
25a26
```

Removed lines `0`, added lines `1`, added lines ending with their reviews in italics `1`; the page is now 26 lines, sha256 `be2fdb717015…`. **Met.**

### A4 — The trace check over this report exits 0

Run after this report's last write, the window line included; a trial at 2026-10-31 19:31:19 UTC, before the window line, printed the same finding. It prints one finding and exits 1. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/A4_trace_check.txt`:

```text
finding: input-changed: ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_kinds/analysis.md — sha256:a5054bec7db8 at issue (20261031T192637Z_MR_issued_C-2026-10-31-27.yaml), sha256:a5054bec7db8 at start, sha256:be2fdb717015 now
```

Every other line agrees: the answer, the downstream artefact, «outputs: 3 of 3 named exist», «inputs: 5 of 6 … hash the same now». The one finding is the page itself: the instruction names `_kinds/analysis.md` both in its `inputs` and in its `outputs`, and the task is to change it, so the check cannot exit 0 once the task is done; the checksums at issue and at start agree with the copy taken before the write (`a5054bec7db8…`, A3). `trace_check.py --help` offers no option for an input that is also an output. **Not met** as written — the cause is in the instruction (section 5 below); nothing was undone to make it pass.

### A5 — `started` and `finished` stand beside the `issued` entry, which carries `answers_kind: item`

The `started` entry was written at 2026-10-31 19:28:35 UTC (`20261031T192835Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-27.yaml`). The `finished` entry follows this report; `ledger.py show` is run after it and kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/A5_show.txt`. Its result is for the review to read: this report is written before the entry it would show.

## 3. Found, not fixed

1. The second questions review proposes a part-1 item in its own words (`_reviews/REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md:124`). This round did not add it: the instruction directs one line to part 3 for these gaps and "Change no other line". Item 7 still names a dependency declared one way and not one declared in neither; whether part 1 should carry it as well is the orchestrator's to judge.
2. The third commit review (`_reviews/REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md:60` to `64`) records that its round's ledger entries spell paths `~/IdeaProjects/…`; the ledger wrote this round's started entry the same way (section 9 of the procedure says it does).

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing the instruction asks.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

- **Model.** The instruction names Sonnet; this session is configured for `claude-opus-5-5`, as the declaration says.
- **The prescribed line, widened.** Section 3.3 gives the part-3 line's content as every dependency "listed both ways" and every rival judged under the other recommendations "with a run that builds each rival beside them". The line written adds "listed from every proposal's words" and "reads it against the ruled settings and the other recommendations' words, not the counts alone", because those are the two points of the second review's G1 (`_reviews/REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md:116` and `:124`) that items 3 and 7 do not carry. It is still one line.
- **A4 cannot be met as written.** The declaration's `inputs` names `_kinds/analysis.md`, which `ledger.py issued` pinned, and its `outputs` names the same file, which section 3 changes; the trace check names any pinned input that differs now `input-changed`. A next version could drop the page from `inputs` (the before copy and A3's diff prove its state) or state A4 net of that one finding.
- **started_by.** Written `unknown`: a scheduled task fired this session (section 1 of the instruction).

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing. The review C-2026-10-31-28 is started after the `finished` entry.

## 7. The outputs, by path

Taken at 2026-10-31 19:31:19 UTC (the computer's clock is UTC+2, so `ls` prints 21:xx). Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/S7_listing.txt`:

```text

This report was listed in the same run, exit 0, and has been written again since; its size is not claimed here.
