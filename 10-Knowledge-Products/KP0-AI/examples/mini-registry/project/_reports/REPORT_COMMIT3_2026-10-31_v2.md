# ACCOUNT — Commit the day's files in the mini registry's repository and in the coordination's, with no push (version 2)

**Answers:** `PROMPT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md` (C-2026-10-31-23, version 2) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh via Desktop Commander (the sandbox shell `device_bash` was used only to read the instruction)

## 1. The answer first

One commit in each repository, no push, no remote: mini-registry `e184746` (23 files) and _coordination `62659d9` (15 files). Evidence was kept in a temporary folder outside both repositories until after the commits (`/var/folders/6y/40d0sz1n74b_xthlcjnkq6fc0000gp/T/tmp.TsY1TJEkXV`) and then copied to ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-v2/_evidence. Nothing found that changes the picture.

## 2. Criteria

| Criterion | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| B1 status empty straight after the commits | `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-v2/_evidence/after_status_mini-registry.txt` and `after_status__coordination.txt`: both 0 bytes | met |
| A2 one new commit each, no remote | `log_*.txt`: e184746 on top of 7f8fa98; 62659d9 on top of f4c9345. `remote_*.txt`: both 0 bytes | met |
| A3 nothing ignored committed | `ignored_committed_*.txt` (`git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard`): both 0 bytes | met |
| B2 committed = before list | `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-v2/_evidence/B2.txt`: mini-registry 23 vs 23, 0 missing, 0 extra; _coordination 15 vs 15, 0 missing, 0 extra (untracked directories in the before list expanded to their files) | met |
| B3 status after step 5 | `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-v2/_evidence/B3_status.txt`: mini-registry names only `_working/round-commit3-v2/` (plus this report once written, see final status in section 7); _coordination names only the ledger entry this round's finished entry writes | see section 7 |
| A5 trace check | run at the end, output in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-v2/_evidence/trace_check.out` | see section 7 |
| A6 ledger entries | `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-v2/_evidence/ledger_show.out` | see section 7 |

## 3. Found, not fixed

- A5 names `REPORT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md` (version 1's report), while this version's report is `REPORT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31_v2.md`; the check was run over the v2 report.
- Commit time is stamped 21:22 +0200 (Tallinn) by git's own configuration; no identity was set.

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing beyond section 7's late checks.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

Section 1 asks for Desktop Commander `start_process`; it was used. The `started` entry says `--effort unknown` as the instruction's template gave.

## 6. Uncommitted by design

This report, _working/round-commit3-v2/_evidence, and the `finished` ledger entry in _coordination/_ledger/. No second commit made.

## 7. Outputs and late checks

See `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-v2/_evidence/final_checks.txt`.

### Late checks (read after the finished entry; `_working/round-commit3-v2/_evidence/final_checks.txt`, `trace_check.out`, `ledger_show.out`)

- A5: trace check over this report exits 0, "trace check: clean".
- A6: `ledger.py show` prints the started (20261031T192204Z) and finished (20261031T192304Z) entries.
- B3: mini-registry status names `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` (modified), `_reports/REPORT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31_v2.md` and `_working/round-commit3-v2/`. **Departure:** `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` is rewritten by `ledger.py` on each ledger entry (it printed "rebuilt"); it is not this round's evidence or report, and it stands uncommitted. _coordination names only `_ledger/20261031T192304Z_MR_finished_C-2026-10-31-23.yaml`. So B3 is met for _coordination and met for mini-registry except for that one program-rebuilt file.
- No second commit was made to chase these files.
