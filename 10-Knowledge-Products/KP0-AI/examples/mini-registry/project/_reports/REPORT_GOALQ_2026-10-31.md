# ACCOUNT — Write a short paper that recommends an answer to each of the goal's 13 open questions, for the owner's ruling

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_GOALQ_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-17`) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`, proved by `date -u; hostname`, which printed `Sat Oct 31 17:54:27 UTC 2026` and `MacBookPro`

## 1. The answer first

The paper recommends one answer to each of the goal's 13 questions in 19,984 bytes, with 18 dependencies declared both ways, and the goal walked through with every recommendation applied adds two failures (F-6, a record not saved; F-7, a different child taken for a learner), no step and no screen: the goal keeps five screens, SC-4 renamed "the entry refused" to carry every refusal of the entry, each screen with R-17's line. The recommendations in short: every check of the entry (all four entered, spaces only counting as missing; the date a day of the calendar in YYYY-MM-DD; the school one of the 3) runs before the search and every fault is named on SC-4, the entries kept; no age is held on the clerk's entry; a failed save is shown on SC-5; SC-2 shows the learner number and all four fields, with no notice of a different school; a different child sharing the three fields is named F-7, a limit of the brief's rule; every result screen offers a way back to SC-1. Every recommendation is a proposal; nothing widens the search.

## 2. The criteria, one by one

**A1 — met.** `list_questions.py`, run through `run` at 2026-10-31T18:02:09Z, lists the questions into `QUESTIONS.md`.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/A1.log`:
```
13
0 not found
exit=0
```

**A2 — met.** `check_paper.py ... A2`, at 2026-10-31T18:02:46Z, also compares each section's quoted question with `QUESTIONS.md`.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/A2.log`:
```
questions listed: 13 sections: 13
0 unanswered, 0 extra
sections whose quoted question differs from QUESTIONS.md: 0
```

**A3 — met.** Every `` `path:line` «words» `` and every quoted question, at 2026-10-31T18:02:47Z; ranges checked to lie within their files.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/A3.log`:
```
quoted passages checked: 40 line ranges checked: 11
0 not found, 0 wrong line
```

**A4 — met.** Positions, tables and proposals counted per section; every row of `A4.log` reads `| 2 | 1 | 1`, for Q-1 to Q-13.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/A4.log`:
```
Q-1 | 2 | 1 | 1
Q-13 | 2 | 1 | 1
```

**A5 — met.** The 18 pairs of the paper's table, each against both sections' declarations, and every declaration against the table; then, per section, the questions named in its positions, table and passages against its "Depends on". The dependencies were listed by this session from the words of each recommendation; the program checks their declaration, not their completeness.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/A5.log`:
```
pairs in the table: 18
0 one-way
Q-1 depends on [7]; judged under the recommendations of [7]; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-2 depends on none; judged under the recommendations of none; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-3 depends on none; judged under the recommendations of none; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-4 depends on [5]; judged under the recommendations of [5]; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-5 depends on [7]; judged under the recommendations of [7]; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-6 depends on [7]; judged under the recommendations of [7]; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-7 depends on none; judged under the recommendations of none; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-8 depends on [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]; judged under the recommendations of [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-9 depends on [1, 5, 6, 7, 8]; judged under the recommendations of [1, 5, 6, 7, 8]; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-10 depends on none; judged under the recommendations of none; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-11 depends on [10]; judged under the recommendations of [10]; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-12 depends on [10, 11]; judged under the recommendations of [10, 11]; named outside its dependencies: none
Q-13 depends on [8]; judged under the recommendations of [8]; named outside its dependencies: none
0 judged under an answer it does not depend on
```

Both positions of each question are judged under the same recommendations, those listed above. An earlier run of the same check (`A5` at 18:02:11Z, log since overwritten; runs 5 and 10 of `RECORD.txt`) found 0 pairs because of a fault in the program's reading of the table, fixed before the run quoted.

**A6 — met.** The rows of "Taken together" against the goal's headings `### S-`, `### F-`, `### SC-`.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/A6.log`:
```
rows of Taken together: 17
0 missing, 0 extra
screens in the final list: 5 ; without R-17's line: 0
```

**A7 — met.** What each recommendation touches; none reads the key table or the reset's record, none adds a goal, and the search's three fields and its one forgiveness are unchanged in all 13.

| Q | Touches | The search |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | S-3, F-2: a date naming no day refused | not touched |
| 2 | nothing: no age held on the entry | not touched |
| 3 | S-6: F-6, shown on SC-5 | not touched |
| 4 | S-3, F-1: spaces only an entry missing | compares names as entered, spaces included |
| 5 | S-2, S-3, F-1, SC-4 | runs after all four entered, as `search_rule.csv:10` |
| 6 | S-3, F-3, SC-4 | the school still never searched on |
| 7 | the order of S-3 and S-4 | what it compares unchanged |
| 8 | the words of SC-4, SC-5; entries kept | not touched |
| 9 | SC-4: every fault | not touched |
| 10 | SC-2's content | not touched |
| 11 | SC-2: no notice | not touched; nothing changed |
| 12 | F-7 named, at S-4/S-5 | not touched; no goal for correcting |
| 13 | a way back to SC-1 from each result | not touched; no goal added |

**A8 — met.** `wc -c` at 2026-10-31T18:02:48Z, the paper's last write being 18:02:31Z.

The 14 sources hashed at 17:54:59Z (`sha256_start.txt`) and at 18:03:00Z (`sha256_end.txt`):

```
identical: 14 files, 0 changed
```

**A9 — met.** Both run directly, outside `run`, at 2026-10-31T18:04:30Z, once this report existed (an earlier placement run at 18:03:00Z found the report missing, as it then was).

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/A9_placement.log`:
```
placement check: clean
exit=0
```

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/A9_trace.log`:
```
outputs: 3 of 3 named exist
trace check: clean
exit=0
```

**A10 — run last.** `round_record.py check` with `--report` this file and `--out` `record/check.out`, the round's last act before the `finished` entry; its result is in `check.out`, which the review runs again.

**A11 — met in part at writing.** `ledger.py show` at 2026-10-31T18:03:35Z prints the `issued` and `started` entries, `A11_show_before.log`; the `finished` entry is written after this report and names it.

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/A11_show_before.log`:
```
20261031T174355Z_MR_issued_C-2026-10-31-17.yaml

```

## 3. Found, not fixed

- The second commit's report, review and evidence (`_reports/REPORT_COMMIT2_2026-10-31.md`, `_reviews/REVIEW_COMMIT2_2026-10-31.md`, `_working/round-commit2-review/`, five files of `_working/round-commit2/_evidence/`) stand untracked in the repository, with `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` modified; read by `git status --short` at the round's start.
- The ledger and `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` name this estate's files under `~/IdeaProjects/mini-registry/`, while the instruction and the constants put the estate at `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry`.

## 4. What I could not establish

Whether the 18 dependencies are every pair that bears: they were listed by hand from the recommendations' words, and the A5 program checks their declaration both ways, not their completeness.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

- "Under 20 KB" read as under 20,000 bytes; the paper's 19,984 meets it under either reading.
- Section 3 asks for the recommendation "in one sentence"; Q-4's proposal answers the question's three parts in one sentence.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing of the instruction's task. The owner's ruling on the 13 proposals is next; round 6 builds from it.

## 7. The outputs, by path

`~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-03b-goalq/_evidence/ls_outputs.log`:
```
-rw-r--r--@ 1 owner  staff  19984 Oct 31 20:02 ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/docs/GOAL-QUESTIONS-PAPER.md

```

Each `ls -ld` exited 0; the report's own listing, taken before this section was written, is in the same log.
