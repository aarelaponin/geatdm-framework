# ACCOUNT — Amend the page of the kind of work for the three gaps of the kind item that the ledger names recurring (version 2)

**Answers:** `PROMPT_KIND_ITEM_2026-10-31.md` (C-2026-10-31-27, version 2) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander's `start_process`; the sandbox shell `device_bash` was used once, to read the instruction

## 1. The answer first

Version 2 changed nothing in `_kinds/analysis.md`. Against the three reviews and the page as it now stands, by a check of its own (`check_lines.sh`, awk + sed + `grep -F`, not version 1's `check_gaps.py`): the four gaps of kind `item` in version 1's `GAPS.md` stand at their lines (8 quotations, 0 not found), and are the four G-lines of the three reviews' sections 7; every page line version 1 named as carrying a gap stands at its line of the page and of the commit instruction (11 quotations, 0 not found). The page is 26 lines, sha256 `be2fdb717015…`, exactly as version 1's diff left it: one line added to part 3, none removed. The two analysis gaps are carried by part 1, item 7 and part 3, line 26; the two commit gaps have no page and are carried by the commit instruction's version 2.

## 2. The criteria, one by one

### A1 — `GAPS.md` holds the four gaps, each quoted at its line; a command shows each is in its file → `0 not found`

Run at 2026-10-31 19:40:16 UTC over version 1's `_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/GAPS.md`. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-v2/_evidence/A1_gaps.txt`:

```text
8 quotations, 0 not found
exit=0
```

The check was shown to catch a fault: a copy with "Q-6 judges" changed to "Q-7 judges" (`GAPS.planted.md`) gave `8 quotations, 1 not found`, `exit=1`, in the same log. The set: sections 7 of the three reviews hold 4 G-lines of kind `item` (lines 107; 99; 53 and 54), and `GAPS.md` has 4 G-headings, both counted by command in the same log. **Met.**

### A2 — For each gap, the page line that carries it, quoted

Run at 2026-10-31 19:40:26 UTC over version 1's `_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/PAGE_LINES.md`, against the page as it now stands (26 lines). Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-v2/_evidence/A2_page_lines.txt`:

```text
11 quotations, 0 not found
exit=0
```

| Gap | Page | The line that carries it |
|---|---|---|
| GA1 — `REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md:107`, Q-6's rival judged without Q-5 as recommended | `_kinds/analysis.md` | Part 1, item 7, line 14: «or to declare a dependency between two answers in one direction only.» And part 3, line 26: «Where the questions depend on one another, the instruction asks for every dependency, listed from every proposal's words and declared both ways, and for every rival judged under the other questions' recommendations» |
| GA2 — `REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md:99`, Q-10's rival credited beside Q-8; dependency declared in neither section | `_kinds/analysis.md` | Part 3, line 26: «listed from every proposal's words and declared both ways» and «with a run that builds each rival beside them and reads it against the ruled settings and the other recommendations' words, not the counts alone.»; in part also part 1, item 3, line 10, «3. **To count over a set it has not listed.**» |
| GC1 — `REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md:53`, evidence redirected into the repository being committed | none | No page: the instruction's version 2, `_prompts/PROMPT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md:124`, «1. **Keep every piece of evidence outside both repositories until step 5**», and its test B1 at line 132 |
| GC2 — `REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md:54`, committed set exceeds the before list | none | No page: the instruction's version 2, line 128, «5. Only then copy the folder's files into», and its test B2 at line 133, «`0 missing, 0 extra`» |

4 lines for the 4 gaps of A1. **Met.**

### A3 (version 2: in its place) — version 1's diff, quoted, and the page as that diff left it

Version 1's diff, `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/A3_diff.txt`:

```text
25a26
exit=1
be2fdb717015c8ce4e04bdb12df0cd4c4944a4cffa55458f102077774b172ad4  _kinds/analysis.md
```

The page now, read at 2026-10-31 19:40:26 UTC. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-v2/_evidence/A3_page_state.txt`:

```text
be2fdb717015c8ce4e04bdb12df0cd4c4944a4cffa55458f102077774b172ad4  _kinds/analysis.md
a5054bec7db874e744d0f042f348d099378b2cf0c6c6cedd027f0329843f7514  _working/round-kind-item/_evidence/analysis.before.md
2026-10-31T19:29:59Z 3350
```

The checksum is the one version 1's diff ends with; the diff run again prints `25a26`, 0 removed, 1 added, the one added line ending «*(Added 31 October 2026 from the reviews … gap G1.)*»; the page's last write, 19:29:59 UTC, is before this round's started entry (19:39:00 UTC). **Met** — the page is as version 1 left it.

### A4 — The trace check over this report exits 0

Run after this report's last write. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-v2/_evidence/A4_trace_check.txt`. Its result is for the review to read: the check reads this report's window line, so it runs after it.

### A5 — `started` and `finished` stand beside the `issued` entry, which carries `answers_kind: item`

`ledger.py show` at 2026-10-31 19:40 UTC, before the finished entry. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-v2/_evidence/A5_show_before_finished.txt`: the version-2 `issued` entry `20261031T193606Z_MR_issued_C-2026-10-31-27.yaml` (`version: 2`, `answers_kind: item`) and this round's `started` entry `20261031T193900Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-27.yaml` (`version: 2`, `account: (account removed)`). The `finished` entry follows this report; `show` is run again after it, into `A5_show.txt` in the same folder, for the review to read.

## 3. Found, not fixed

1. The ledger pins the sixth input, `FINDING-KINDS.md` under `~/Library/Application Support/…`, as `~/Library/Application absent` in the version-2 `issued` and `started` entries too (`A5_show_before_finished.txt`): a path with a space is cut at it. As the review of version 1 found (§8.4).
2. The version-2 `issued` entry carries `subject: "MR C-2026-10-31-28"`, the review task's identifier (`A5_show_before_finished.txt`); what the field means was not looked up.
3. Part 1 of the page still names a dependency declared one way, not one declared in neither (`_reviews/REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md:124`); as version 1's report and review said, the orchestrator's to judge.

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing the instruction asks.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

- **Model.** The instruction names Sonnet; this session is configured for `claude-opus-5-5`.
- **A4's path.** Section 5's A4 names `REPORT_KIND_ITEM_2026-10-31.md`; version 2 names this report as the `--report` of the finished entry and the declaration's `downstream_artefact` is `_v2`, so the trace check is run over this file.
- **Evidence of section 6.** Section 6 names `_working/round-kind-item/_evidence/`; version 2 names `_working/round-kind-item-v2/_evidence/`, which was used. Version 1's folder was only read.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing. The review C-2026-10-31-28 is started after the `finished` entry.

## 7. The outputs, by path

Taken at 2026-10-31 19:40:49 UTC. Log `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-v2/_evidence/S7_listing.txt`:

```text
drwxr-xr-x@ 10 owner  staff  320 Oct 31 21:40 ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-v2/_evidence
exit=0
```

The computer's clock is UTC+2, so `ls` prints 21:xx. This report is written after the listing; its size is not claimed here.
