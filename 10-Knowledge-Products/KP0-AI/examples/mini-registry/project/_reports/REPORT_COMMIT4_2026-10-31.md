written_by: a working session, separate from the session that wrote the instruction
account: (account removed) — read from the line of this session's own context that begins "The user's email address is"
started_by: unknown — a scheduled task started this session; its prompt shows no owner typing the start message
model: claude-sonnet-5-5 — read from the line of this session's own context that names the model it is configured for (the instruction names Sonnet)
computer: MacBookPro — printed by `hostname`, the round's first command, through Desktop Commander's start_process (zsh)
window: 2026-10-31 21:46:16 UTC to 2026-10-31 21:48:14 UTC, no pause; closed at the last write of the 1636 files the round names as written, REPORT_COMMIT4_2026-10-31.md, read by stat; printed by round_record.py window, its command and output kept in ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4/_evidence/window.out
record: none — the round keeps no round_record.py record, as the instruction says: its writes are git acts and its own evidence, which B1 to B4 prove

# ACCOUNT — Commit everything waiting in the mini registry and in the coordination, with no push, so that both deliverables are delivered

**Answers:** `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_prompts/PROMPT_COMMIT4_2026-10-31.md` (`C-2026-10-31-33`) · **Run on:** MacBookPro, zsh through Desktop Commander

## 1. The answer first

Two commits, one in each repository, no push, no remote, no ignore list changed, nothing force-added. The mini registry's is `8484d16` (676 files: 57 lines of the "before" list, directories expanded), the coordination's is `ab3cc36` (81 files). Both statuses were empty straight after (0 bytes each). The temporary folder was `/var/folders/6y/40d0sz1n74b_xthlcjnkq6fc0000gp/T/tmp.b4SOGedZXM`; its files were copied to `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4/_evidence/` only after both commits (step 5).

## 2. The criteria, one by one

**B1 — status empty after both commits.** Met. `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4/_evidence/after_status_mini-registry.txt` and `.../after_status__coordination.txt` are each 0 bytes (`wc -c` printed `0` for both in the commit act). The same files, recorded in the temporary folder before the copy, are the ones quoted.

**B2 — committed files equal the "before" list.** Met. For each repository the "before" lines (not `!!`) were taken from `before_<repo>.txt`, directories expanded with `git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD -- <dir>`, sorted, and compared by `comm` with `git show --name-only --format= HEAD`. Mini registry: 676 and 676, `0 missing, 0 extra`; coordination: 81 and 81, `0 missing, 0 extra`. Files: `before_files_*.txt`, `show_sorted_*.txt`, `missing_*.txt`, `extra_*.txt` in the evidence folder (the missing and extra files are empty).

**B3 — status after the report is written.** See section 2a below.

**B4 — nothing ignored committed.** Met. `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` printed nothing in either (`ci_mini-registry.txt`, `ci__coordination.txt`, both empty). `docs/note/NOTE.pdf` stood in the "before" list as `!! docs/note/NOTE.pdf` and `git ls-files | grep -c 'NOTE.pdf'` printed `0` for the mini registry; it is not in the commit. The two other ignored paths of the coordination, `MEASURES.md` and `WHO.html`, were likewise left out.

**B5 — no remote.** Met. `git remote -v` printed nothing in either (`remote_mini-registry.txt`, `remote__coordination.txt`, both empty).

**B6 — `ls -ld` and the window.** See section 7 and the `window` line of the declaration.

**B7 — trace check.** See section 2a.

**B8 — ledger entries.** See section 2a.

## 2a. Readings after the report was written

Read by command after the report was written, in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4/_evidence/b3_status_with_mtimes.txt` (each line of `git status --porcelain` with the file's modification time, against the commit time 2026-10-31T23:46:44+02:00 of both repositories):

- **B3 — met.** Mini registry names two lines: `_reports/REPORT_COMMIT4_2026-10-31.md` (modified 23:47:25) and `_working/round-commit4/` (23:47:05), this round's report and evidence, both after the commit time. `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` is not named at this reading, since the ledger rebuilt it at the `started` entry, before the commit, and the commit carried it; the `finished` entry will rebuild it again, after this reading. Coordination names no line at this reading. The `finished` entry's ledger file will be the next, written after the commit's time.
- **B7 — met.** The trace check over this report exited 0 and printed `trace check: clean` with 4 of 4 outputs named existing; its output and exit are in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4/_evidence/trace_check.out` (run again after the last edit of this report, which is the one kept).
- **B8 — read after the `finished` entry**, which cannot be written before this report is final: `ledger.py show --constants ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/CONSTANTS.md --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-33` is run after it and its output kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4/_evidence/ledger_show.out`; the review reads it.

## 3. Found, not fixed

- The ledger's Open block still lists C-2026-10-31-27 (version 2) of "MR · work · the pages against the kind item" although its own text says it finished 31 Oct 2026, 19:41 UTC; it is not running, so the round went on. A produced view is stale; nothing was repaired.
- The commit messages carry the round lines as lines of one paragraph without a blank line, as the instruction asks for one line and then one line per round; `git log --oneline` therefore shows the whole body after the subject.

## 4. What I could not establish

Nothing that a criterion asked for.

## 5. Corrections to the instruction

None. The instruction names the shell tool `start_process`; it was used through its full plugin name. `started_by` and `effort` are `unknown`, as the instruction allows for a scheduled start.

## 6. What this round did not finish

Nothing. The review follows the `finished` entry.

## 7. The outputs, by path

Listings taken by `ls -ld` after the report was written, in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4/_evidence/ls_ld_after_report.txt`; each exited 0:

- `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/.git` — exit 0
- `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/_coordination/.git` — exit 0
- `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4/_evidence` — exit 0
- `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_reports/REPORT_COMMIT4_2026-10-31.md` — exit 0 (5,322 bytes when listed, before sections 2a and 7 were filled in)

The same four were listed before the report existed, in `ls_ld_pre_report.txt` (the report's own listing exited 1 then, as it should).
