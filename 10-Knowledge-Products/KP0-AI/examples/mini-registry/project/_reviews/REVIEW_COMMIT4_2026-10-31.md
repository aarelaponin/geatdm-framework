# REVIEW — the delivery commit

Evidence (all commands and full outputs) is in ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit4-review/_evidence/ : git_readings.out, checks.out, more.out, more2.out, diff_mini-registry.txt, diff__coordination.txt. Nothing was changed; no git command that writes was run.

## 1. The tests of success

| Test | Met | Evidence read here |
|---|---|---|
| B1 status empty after both commits | met | `after_status_mini-registry.txt` and `after_status__coordination.txt` in the round's evidence folder are 0 bytes each (`wc -c` in checks.out). |
| B2 committed files = the before list | met | The round's `missing_*` and `extra_*` files are 0 lines each (checks.out). Re-done here: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD` sorted, compared by `comm -3` with the round's `show_sorted_*` gives 0 differing lines in both repositories (more.out). The mini registry's before list has 55 non-ignored lines (8 modified, 47 untracked entries, directories expanded to files) and the commit has 668 added and 8 modified paths, the 8 modified being exactly the 8 ` M` lines (WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md, _kinds/analysis.md, _kinds/building.md, 5 prompts, src/package.json). The coordination's before list has 81 non-ignored lines, 81 files in the commit. |
| B3 status after the report | met | See section 2 below, from git_readings.out. |
| B4 nothing ignored committed | met | `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` prints 0 lines in both; `git ls-files \| grep -c NOTE.pdf` prints 0; the commit names no `.DS_Store` and no NOTE.pdf (more.out, git_readings.out). The ignored lines of the before lists were `.DS_Store`, `docs/note/NOTE.pdf` (mini registry) and `MEASURES.md`, `WHO.html` (coordination). |
| B5 no remote | met | `git remote -v` printed 0 bytes in both (git_readings.out). |
| B6 `ls -ld` and the window | met, with one observation | `ls_ld_after_report.txt` carries four `ls -ld` listings, each followed by `exit 0`. The window line was written by `round_record.py window --write`; its command is the `# run with:` line of `window.out`. The observation on its close is in section 6. |
| B7 trace check | met | Re-run here: `trace check: clean`, exit 0, 4 of 4 outputs named exist (checks.out, "## trace"). |
| B8 started and finished entries | met | `ledger.py show` for C-2026-10-31-33 prints the issued, started and finished entries (section 6 below). |

B3 in full, from git_readings.out, taken at 21:48:41 UTC, commit time of both repositories 2026-10-31T23:46:44+02:00 (21:46:44 UTC):

```text

```

Every line is attributable by its place and its time, all after the commit time; no unattributed line. (My own review file and my later guard and ledger entries join the list after this reading.)

## 2. One figure re-established

The file count of each new commit. The report's route: the "before" lists with directories expanded, compared with `git show --name-only --format= HEAD`. The route here: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | wc -l`, and `git show --name-only --format= HEAD | wc -l` as a cross-reading. Mini registry 8484d16: 676 and 676. Coordination ab3cc36: 81 and 81. The report says 676 and 81. They agree. (The report's "57 lines of the 'before' list" is the file's total line count including its 2 ignored `!!` lines; the lines that became the commit are 55. Literally true, easily misread.)

Times and counts the report gives in its own words, read at their source: the window's start 21:46:16 equals the `written` of the started entry (ledger show); the report's last write is 21:48:14.208 UTC by `stat` (window.out and my `stat`); the commit time 23:46:44+02:00 and both hashes (`8484d16...`, `ab3cc36...`) equal `git log -1` here; the commit author is the identity git already has (Arne Laponin) and no remote exists.

## 3. The outputs exist

`.git/` of both repositories (HEAD at the two named hashes, git_readings.out), the round's `_evidence/` folder (34 entries now), and the report (8000 bytes now; 5,322 when the round listed it, before sections 2a and 7 were filled in, as the report says). All found.

## 4. The running application

Not applicable: the round wrote no application model; it committed files.

## 5. What a review of this kind runs

The instruction's `kind_of_work` reads `none — the operations of the estate`; no page of a kind applies and no kind-specific check is named. Nothing to run. The repo-hygiene points of the instruction (no push, no remote, no ignore list change, no force-add) were read in B4 and B5; the ignore lists were not diffed by the round's own account and the commit's file list names no `.gitignore` among the modified paths (the 8 modified paths are listed in B2).

## 6. The four mechanical checks

```text
trace_check.py (report)             exit 0   "trace check: clean"; outputs: 4 of 4 named exist
placement_check.py                  not run — the instruction names it nowhere and this review's task fixes the trace check and the ledger pair only
round_record.py check               not run — the report's record line is "none": the round keeps no round_record.py record
ledger.py show --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-33   exit 0
ledger.py check                     exit 0   "check: clean"
```

Lines of `show` naming `MR` and the account (checks.out):

```text
20261031T214336Z_MR_issued_C-2026-10-31-33.yaml    code: MR · account: (account removed) · version: 1
20261031T214616Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-33.yaml   code: MR · account: (account removed) · written: 2026-10-31T21:46:16Z · started_by: unknown
20261031T214815Z_MR_finished_C-2026-10-31-33.yaml  code: MR · account: (account removed) · written: 2026-10-31T21:48:15Z
```

`ledger.py check` printed `check: clean`; the only lines naming `MR` in its output are the show entries above. The account on the three entries is (account removed), the same as the report's `account`. The placement check is recorded as not run, with its reason; the instruction under review is an operations instruction with no placement of new files beyond its named outputs, and the verdict does not turn on it.

## 7. The verdict

**Accepted.** Every test B1 to B8 is met on evidence read here; the figure holds by a second route; no output is missing; the ledger and trace checks are clean. The number of gaps: 0. Nothing is passed to `--kinds`.

## 8. Found, not fixed

1. **The window closes before the round's last write (kind it would carry: form).** The report's window closes at 21:48:14, "at the last write of the 1636 files the round names as written", the report. In the round's `_evidence/` folder, `trace_check.out` was last written at 21:48:15.05 and `ledger_show.out` at 21:48:15.90 (`stat`, more2.out), and the finished entry is 21:48:15. This follows from the instruction itself: B7 and B8 need the trace check and `ledger show` after the report and after the `finished` entry, while step 5 has `round_record.py window --write` close the window at the report. A criterion that cannot be met as written (B6 with step 5 and B8, lines "B8" and "step 5" of the instruction). It is not counted as a gap of the round. Cure for the next instruction: close the window after B8's evidence, or name those two files as outside the window.
2. The report's "57 lines of the 'before' list" counts the 2 ignored lines; 55 became the commit (section 2). Phrase it as 55 plus 2 ignored.
3. The `_working/round-commit4/` and `_evidence/` folder modification times read 23:48:35, 20 seconds after the last file written in them (23:48:15) and during this review's start. No file in them is newer than 23:48:15 and the status shows no new line; the cause (a directory entry changed, such as a temporary file removed) was not found. Unexplained, harmless to the verdict.
4. Carried from the report, confirmed: the Open block of WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md listing C-2026-10-31-27 was not re-checked here; it is a produced view and outside this review's tests.
5. `started_by: unknown` in the report ("a scheduled task started this session") is not checkable from here; the started entry also reads `started_by: unknown`, so the two agree.
