# REVIEW — the second commit of the day

Evidence kept in `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2-review/_evidence/git_checks.txt` and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit2-review/_evidence/mechanical.txt`. Nothing was changed and no git command that writes was run. Gaps: none (G0).

## 1. The tests of success

- **A1 — met.** Status straight after the commits cannot be re-run (writes followed), so I read what stands now in `git_checks.txt` (17:49:18 UTC) and named each line.
  - mini-registry: ` M WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` (rebuilt by ledger.py on my started entry); `?? _reports/REPORT_COMMIT2_2026-10-31.md` (the report); `?? _working/round-commit2-review/` (my evidence); and eight files under `_working/round-commit2/_evidence/`: `A4_reconcile.txt`, `after__coordination.txt`, `after_mini-registry.txt`, `commit_and_A1.txt`, `ledger_show.out`, `ls_outputs.txt`, `trace_check.out`, `window.out`. All are the round's post-commit writes, listed in the report's section 6. No other line.
  - _coordination: `?? _ledger/20261031T174844Z_MR_finished_C-2026-10-31-15.yaml` (the round's finished entry) and `?? _ledger/20261031T174911Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-16.yaml` (mine). No other line.
  - The round's own record: `commit_and_A1.txt` stamps both commits and both empty status reads at 17:47:02-03 UTC; the commit time in git (19:47:03 +0200) agrees.
- **A2 — met.** One new commit each: c419cf3 over 2fad722 (mini-registry), 42cfa12 over 2ba3804 (_coordination); `git remote -v` prints nothing in either, exit 0.
- **A3 — met.** `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` prints nothing in either. Ignored entries present and untracked: `.DS_Store`, `MEASURES.md`, `WHO.html`.
- **A4 — met at the level of files, not as literally written.** The literal equality (42 collapsed lines vs 201) fails, and the report says so. I re-counted: before-status has 5 ` M` + 37 `??` (10 of them folders) = 42; the `-uall` listing holds 200; HEAD holds 201; the one difference is the round's own `before_uall__coordination.txt`, written before the commit. In _coordination 52 = 52. The five modified files are those listed in the report. The fault is the criterion's wording, not the round's.
- **A5 — met.** Trace check exit 0, "trace check: clean" (`mechanical.txt`).
- **A6 — met.** `ledger.py show` prints the issued (17:43:53Z), started (17:46:10Z) and finished (17:48:44Z) entries of C-2026-10-31-15. Account on all three: `(account removed)`; the report's declaration names the same. The started entry carries `started_by: unknown`, as the report declares.

## 2. One figure re-established

The number of files in each commit, by a route the report did not use (`git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | wc -l`, `--name-status` tally, and `ls-tree -r --name-only` of HEAD against HEAD~1):

- mini-registry: 201 files (196 A + 5 M); trees 473 - 277 = 196 new paths, which agrees with 196 added. Report: 201. Agree.
- _coordination: 52 files, all A; trees 97 - 45 = 52. Report: 52. Agree. Composition read by directory: 15 in `_guards`, 37 in `_ledger`, as the report says.

Times and counts the report gives in prose, read at source: window opens 17:46:10 UTC (started entry `written`), agrees; window closes 17:48:28 UTC, equals the report's `stat` mtime (19:48:28 local); commits at 17:47:03 UTC, agrees with git; the report's 42 / 5 / 37 / 10 / 200 counts agree with `A4_reconcile.txt` and with my `grep -c` of `before_mini-registry.txt`; the evidence folder holds the 4 before files and 8 after files the report names.

## 3. The outputs exist

All four named outputs exist: both `.git` folders (commits above), the evidence folder, and the report (9196 bytes per its `ls_outputs.txt`); the trace check reports "outputs: 4 of 4 named exist".

## 4. The running application

Not applicable: the round wrote no application model.

## 5. What a review of this kind runs

Not applicable: the instruction's `kind_of_work` reads `none`; the kind is `none`, with no page.

## 6. The mechanical checks

- Trace check over the report: exit 0, clean.
- Placement check and round-record check: not run. The instruction names the trace check, `ledger.py show` and `ledger.py check` only, and the round kept no `round_record.py` record, as the instruction rules; there is nothing for them to read.
- `ledger.py show --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-15`: exit 0, issued/started/finished printed (see A6).
- `ledger.py check`: exit 0, "check: clean".
- No record was kept by the instruction.

## 7. The verdict

**Accepted.** Every criterion is met or met at the level it can be, the counts hold by an independent route, and nothing ignored was committed. Gaps: none.

## 8. Found, not fixed

1. A4's wording cannot hold when an untracked folder is listed as one line; this is the second report of the day to meet it. The instruction should name `-uall` for the before status.
2. `repo-hygiene` commits a `local` project's own files by name, whereas the instruction orders `git add -A`; the round followed the instruction (as the report notes).
3. The report records `claude-opus-5-5` for a round whose instruction names Sonnet; it is declared in the report, not a gap in the work.
4. The mini-registry commit message has no blank line after its first line, so the "one line plus one line per round" shape reads as one long subject under `git log --oneline`. Cosmetic.
5. The issued and started entries record instruction paths as `~/IdeaProjects/...` while the files are under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/`; `show` resolves them "on disk", so no break, but the declared paths differ.
6. The `window.out` lists 712 files the round "names as written" including `.git` sample hooks dated 12:49 UTC; the window closes correctly on the report, so no effect.
7. This review's model is Sonnet, the band the review instruction names; no deviation.
