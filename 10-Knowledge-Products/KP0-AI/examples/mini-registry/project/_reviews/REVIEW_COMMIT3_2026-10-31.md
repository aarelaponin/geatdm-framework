# REVIEW — third commit of the day

Evidence: ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-review/_evidence/ (review_git.out, review_checks.out, review_extra.out). Nothing was changed; no git command that writes was run. Verdict line: **not accepted** — 2 gaps.

## 1. The tests

- **A1 — NOT MET.** Re-run at 19:15:09 UTC (`review_git.out`). Mini registry prints 16 lines; coordination 2. Every line is accounted for:
  - mini-registry, round's own evidence/report, all named in report section 6: ` M _working/round-commit3/_evidence/commit_and_A1.txt`, `?? _reports/REPORT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md`, A4_*, after_*, committed_list_*, ledger_show.out, ls_outputs.txt, show_stat_*, trace_check.out, window.out; ` M WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` (rebuilt by ledger.py, named in section 6); `?? _working/round-commit3-review/` is this review's own folder. No unaccounted line.
  - coordination: `_ledger/…MR_finished_C-2026-10-31-23.yaml` (the round's finished entry, named) and `…MR_started_C-2026-10-31-24.yaml` (this review's started entry).
  - These are the expected post-commit lines. The criterion itself failed at commit time, as the report says: `commit_and_A1.txt` (committed with 2 lines, now 10; `git diff --stat HEAD` shows +8) was modified straight after the commits. The report states this honestly and the finished entry says so.
- **A2 — met.** One new commit each: mini-registry 7f8fa98 over c419cf3; coordination f4c9345 over 42cfa12. `git remote -v` prints nothing in either.
- **A3 — met.** `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` prints nothing in either.
- **A4 — not literally met, accepted by the report as such.** I recompared (comm of sorted lists): mini-registry committed minus before list = exactly `before_list__coordination.txt` and `commit_and_A1.txt`, nothing missing; coordination identical (50/50). The report's account holds, but "the files of `git show --stat HEAD` are the files the before status listed, and no other" is false for the mini registry by two files.
- **A5 — met.** trace_check.py exit 0, "trace check: clean".
- **A6 — met.** `ledger.py show` prints issued (19:09:31Z), started (19:12:33Z) and finished (19:14:35Z).

## 2. One figure re-established

Files per commit. Report route: `git show --stat HEAD`. My route: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | wc -l` and `ls-tree -r --name-only` counts. Mini registry 231 (ls-tree 473 -> 703 = +230 net, one file modified; 230 A + 1 M); coordination 50 (97 -> 147). Insertions 35371 / 4 deletions and 597 insertions agree with the report. Agree. Window: report mtime 21:14:19 local = 19:14:19 UTC, matches the window close; start 19:12:33 matches the started entry. The "8 lines" of the report is the diff insertion count (committed version 2 lines), consistent.

## 3. Outputs exist

Both .git folders, the evidence folder, the report: found (trace check "outputs: 4 of 4 named exist"). Evidence files listed in the report exist (ls of the folder, `review_checks.out`).

## 4. Running application

Not applicable — no application model written.

## 5. Page of the kind

Not applicable — `kind_of_work` reads `none`.

## 6. Mechanical checks

Trace check: clean, exit 0. `ledger.py show`: the three entries, account (account removed) on all three, equal to the report's declaration. `ledger.py check`: clean, exit 0. No `round_record.py` record was kept, by the instruction; the placement and record checks are therefore not run. Note `started_by: owner` on the started entry against the report's own statement that a scheduled task fired it (reported by the round, not rewritten).

## 7. Verdict

**Not accepted. 2 gaps.**

- **G1 (item)** — A1 not met: the round's own evidence file was redirected into the repository being committed in the same act as `git add -A`, so mini-registry status was not empty straight after. Fails A1. The instruction set the evidence folder inside the repository and demanded an empty status, which cannot hold; the round also did not hold the file in /tmp as the report says the earlier round did.
- **G2 (item)** — A4 not met literally: the committed set exceeds the before list by two evidence files (`before_list__coordination.txt`, `commit_and_A1.txt`). Same cause as G1.

Neither gap involves a push, a remote, an ignored file or a changed content.

## 8. Found, not fixed

- Model: the round ran on claude-opus-5-5 where the instruction names Sonnet (stated in report section 5).
- The ledger's issued/started entries record paths as `~/IdeaProjects/mini-registry/...` while files live under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/`; the ledger resolves them "on disk" here, but the spelling differs from the instruction's.
- Commit messages follow the instruction; the mini-registry message lists rounds.
- repo-hygiene conflict with `git add -A` (reported by the round) stands for the orchestrator.
- Next version should name a location outside both repositories for the evidence written during the commit act, or state A1/A4 net of the round's own evidence.
