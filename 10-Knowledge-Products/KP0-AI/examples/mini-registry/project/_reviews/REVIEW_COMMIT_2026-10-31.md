# REVIEW — the commit of the day

Evidence (commands, outputs): `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit-review/_evidence/git_checks.out` (all git readings, 15:15:46 UTC) and `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit-review/_evidence/mech_checks.out` (trace check, ledger show and check, file stamps, 15:16:00 UTC). Only git read commands were run; nothing was changed but this review and the evidence folder.

## 1. The tests of success

**A1 — met.** The report's claim concerns the moment straight after the commits (15:13:09 UTC, `commit_and_A1.txt`, both outputs empty, read). Now, `git status --porcelain` prints lines in each repository; each is one the round or the review wrote after its commit:

- mini-registry: ` M WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` (rebuilt by the ledger on the round's `finished` entry and again on my `started` entry); `?? _reports/REPORT_COMMIT_2026-10-31.md` (the report); `?? _working/round-commit-review/` (this review's evidence); nine `?? _working/round-commit/_evidence/` files (`A4_reconcile.txt`, `after__coordination.txt`, `after_mini-registry.txt`, `commit_and_A1.txt`, `ledger_show.out`, `ls_outputs.txt`, `trace_check.out`, `trace_check_first.out`, `window.out`), all stamped 15:13:17 to 15:15:04 UTC, after the commit at 15:13:08.
- _coordination: `?? _guards/20261031T151430Z_trace_check_none_cb27e86684.yaml` (guard record of the round's trace check); `?? _ledger/20261031T151504Z_MR_finished_C-2026-10-31-09.yaml` (the round's `finished`); `?? _ledger/20261031T151531Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-10.yaml` (this review's `started`).

No other line. Nothing unexplained.

**A2 — met.** mini-registry: `2fad722` over `74ca995`; _coordination: `2ba3804` over `f30bc04`; one new commit each; `git remote -v` prints nothing in either (exit 0). Author in both: Arne Laponin, the configured identity.

**A3 — met.** `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` prints nothing in either; `WHO.html`, `MEASURES.md`, `.DS_Store` are absent from both trees.

**A4 — met in substance, not literally, as the report itself says.** As written (count in `show --stat` equals count of new and changed lines of the before status), 262 against 44 does not hold, because the before status collapses untracked folders. I counted the before files: new and changed lines (ignored `!!` excluded) are 44 and 30 in the collapsed status, 261 and 30 at file level (`-uall`), as the report gives. Committed: 262 and 30. The one file of difference in the mini registry is the round's own evidence file written between the listing and the commit, as the report names. The two modified files only gained lines (21/0 and 1/0 by `git diff --numstat --diff-filter=M HEAD~1 HEAD`), so no file's content was changed by the round. The instruction's criterion was defective; the round disclosed that and met its purpose.

**A5 — met.** The trace check over the report, run by me, printed `trace check: clean`, exit 0.

**A6 — met.** `ledger.py show` for C-2026-10-31-09 prints the `issued` (15:07:55), `started` (15:12:15) and `finished` (15:15:04) entries; all three carry account `(account removed)`, the report's account.

## 2. One figure re-established

The number of files in each commit, by a route the report did not use (`git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | wc -l`, and the difference of `git ls-tree -r --name-only` at HEAD and HEAD~1): mini-registry 262 by diff, 277 − 17 = 260 net with 2 modified, so 260 added + 2 modified = 262 (`--diff-filter` A 260, M 2, D 0); _coordination 30 by diff, 45 − 15 = 30, all added. The report gives 262 (260 added, 2 modified) and 30. Agree.

Also read at source: the report's window closes 15:14:50 UTC, which is the stat of the report (17:14:50 local) and the last stamp in `window.out`; it opens at the `started` entry's 15:12:15; the 432 files figure is `window.out`'s own line; the three before-counts above agree.

## 3. The outputs exist

`.git/` of both repositories, the evidence folder (15 files) and the report all stand at their paths (`mech_checks.out`, evidence listing; `ls_outputs.txt` of the round); the trace check's own line reads `outputs: 4 of 4 named exist`. The report is 8495 bytes, as the round's listing says.

## 4. The page of the kind and the running application

Not applicable: `kind_of_work` reads `none — the operations of the estate`, and the round wrote no application model.

## 5. The mechanical checks

Trace check over the report: exit 0, `clean`. `ledger.py show --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-09`: exit 0, three entries as above. `ledger.py check`: exit 0, `check: clean`. No `round_record.py` record was kept, by the instruction (its section 5) and the report's `record` line; the placement check and the record check are not required by this instruction's third section and were not run.

## 6. The verdict

**Accepted.** A1 to A6 are met on my own re-run; the one literal shortfall (A4) is the instruction's, stated and reconciled by the round. No gaps.

## 7. Found, not fixed

- The report's section 6 lists the files left uncommitted but names seven of the nine evidence files; `ls_outputs.txt` and `trace_check_first.out` are missing from it. Both stand untracked. (Kind it would carry: `trace`; not a failure of a test of success.)
- The report's `started_by` says `owner` while describing a scheduled task carrying the start message; the review form reads a scheduled-task start as `unknown`. The ledger's `started` entry also carries `owner`. (Kind: `form`; the verdict does not turn on it.)
- The round ran on claude-opus-5-5 while the instruction names Sonnet; the report discloses it.
- The instruction's A4 and its section 3 step 1 should name the file-level (`-uall`) status; the report found this itself (its section 5).
- `repo-hygiene` step 3 forbids `git add -A` for `local` projects; the instruction ordered it at the owner's word; the round followed the instruction and said so.
- The `issued` and `started` entries carry the path `~/IdeaProjects/mini-registry/...`, where the files lie under `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/`; the ledger resolves the files on disk, so no check failed.
- `mkdir -p` of the reviews folder was run by this review; the folder existed or is the place the constants name.
