# REVIEW (edition 2) — the page of the kind analysis, as version 1 amended it, against the kind item

Evidence: ~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-kind-item-v2-review/_evidence/ (figure.log, trace.log, show27.log, check.log, placement.log).

## 1. The tests of success, one by one

- **A1 met.** The round's `check_lines.sh` (a route different from version 1's) is in its evidence folder; I read it, and read lines 107, 99, 53, 54 of the three reviews myself (figure.log). Each opens with the G-number and kind the quotation gives. The round's log `A1_gaps.txt` prints `8 quotations, 0 not found`, `exit=1` on a planted fault (`Q-6` to `Q-7`), so the check catches a miss. **Met.**
- **A2 met.** Page lines read by me in `_kinds/analysis.md` (26 lines): line 14 (item 7) carries «or to declare a dependency between two answers in one direction only.»; line 26 (part 3) carries «declared both ways» and «every rival judged under the other questions' recommendations, with a run that builds each rival beside them and reads it against the ruled settings and the other recommendations' words, not the counts alone». For the commit gaps, `PROMPT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md` lines 124 (step 1, «Keep every piece of evidence outside both repositories until step 5») and 128 (step 5, «Only then copy the folder's files into»), tests B1 and B2 (lines 132, 133 «0 missing, 0 extra»), read by me. All hold. One loose citation: the report offers part 1 item 3 (line 10) "in part" for GA2; item 3 is about counting over an unlisted set, a near fit at best, and nothing rests on it. **Met.**
- **A3, replaced by my own reading, met.** `diff _working/round-kind-item/_evidence/analysis.before.md _kinds/analysis.md` run by me prints `25a26`, one added line, none removed; the added line ends «*(Added 31 October 2026 from the reviews `_reviews/REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md`, gap G1, and `_reviews/REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md`, gap G1.)*». `shasum -a 256 _kinds/analysis.md` = `be2fdb717015c8ce4e04bdb12df0cd4c4944a4cffa55458f102077774b172ad4`, the value version 1's diff evidence ends with and the report quotes. The page's last write, read with `TZ=UTC stat`, is 2026-10-31T19:29:59Z, before v2's `started` (19:39:00Z). The page is unchanged since version 1's diff.
- **A4 met.** I ran the trace check (trace.log): exit 0, "inputs: 5 of 5 pinned by 20261031T193606Z_MR_issued_C-2026-10-31-27.yaml hash the same now", "trace check: clean". The cause of version 1's failure is gone: the page is no longer an input or an output.
- **A5 met.** `ledger.py show --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-27` (show27.log, exit 0) prints version 1's three `issued`, `started` (19:28:35Z), `finished` (19:32:46Z), then version 2's `issued` (19:36:06Z, `version: 2`, `answers_kind: item`), `started` (19:39:00Z) and `finished` (19:41:56Z). **Accounts:** `issued`, `started`, `finished` each `(account removed)`; the report's declaration names the same. They agree.

## 2. One figure re-established

The figure: four gaps of kind `item` (report §1 and A1). The report's route: its own `check_lines.sh`, awk between `## 7` and `## 8` counting G-lines (4) against GAPS.md headings (4). My route: `grep -nE '^\*\*G[0-9]+ \('` over the three reviews plus a read of section 7 of `REVIEW_COMMIT3` (whose gap lines are list items): `REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md:107 G1 (item)`, `REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md:99 G1 (item)`, `REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md:53 G1 (item)`, `:54 G2 (item)` (figure.log). Four, all `item`. **Agree.**

Times and counts in the report's own words, read at their source: the window closes 19:41:36 UTC, and the report's last write by `TZ=UTC stat` is 19:41:36 (9,952 bytes), no later write; the first window time 19:39:00 equals the `started` entry's `written`. The page's 26 lines and 3,350 bytes (v1 diff evidence) agree with `wc`. The `finished` entry (19:41:56Z) is after the window's close. The report says "10 files the round names as written"; the evidence folder now holds 12 entries, the report claims no total for it.

## 3. The outputs exist

Taken at 19:43 UTC: `_reports/REPORT_KIND_ITEM_2026-10-31_v2.md` 9,952 bytes; `_working/round-kind-item-v2/_evidence/` with 12 entries (`ls | wc -l`). The report does not claim its own size or the folder's total. `placement_check.py` over the instruction (placement.log): clean, exit 0, the report "in its place". All found.

## 4. The running application

Not applicable: the round wrote no application model.

## 5. What a review of this kind runs, from the page of the kind

The instruction's `kind_of_work` reads `none — the method's own work in this estate: amending a page of a kind of work for a kind of gap that recurs`. No page of that kind exists, so no kind-specific check is run; the nearest page, `_kinds/analysis.md`, was read as the amended object.

**Each gap against its line.**
- **GA1** (`REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31.md:107`, Q-6's rival judged without Q-5 as recommended; dependency one way). Item 7 refuses exactly this in the reviewer's words, and line 26 makes the orchestrator check before issuing that every dependency is declared both ways and every rival judged under the other recommendations, with a run that builds each rival. The next instruction of the kind would carry the cure. Yes.
- **GA2** (`REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md:99`, Q-10's rival credited beside Q-8; dependency declared in neither section). Line 26 asks for dependencies "listed from every proposal's words", "declared both ways", and a run read "against the ruled settings and the other recommendations' words, not the counts alone", the two points of `..._v2.md:116` and `:124`. The part 3 line carries the cure. Part 1 does not name "declared in neither" (see section 8, item 2). Sufficient for the next instruction's issue check. Yes.
- **GC1, GC2** (`REVIEW_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md:53, :54`). The kind `none` has no page. The commit instruction's version 2 carries both (step 1, step 5, B1, B2). The instruction directed this ("listed, not written into a page"). The page would not carry them for a later commit instruction written from the template (section 8, item 3).

## 6. The four mechanical checks

```text
trace_check.py --constants mini-registry/CONSTANTS.md --coordination _coordination/CONSTANTS.md <report>
  -> exit 0, "trace check: clean" (trace.log)
placement_check.py <instruction>
  -> exit 0, "placement check: clean" (placement.log)
round_record.py check
  -> not run: the instruction states the round keeps no round_record.py record (its section 5) and the report's record line says none; a check that cannot run is a failure only where a record is owed, and none is
ledger.py show --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-27
  -> exit 0, issued/started/finished of version 2 present, answers_kind: item (show27.log)
ledger.py check --constants _coordination/CONSTANTS.md
  -> exit 1, "check: 2 defects" (check.log)
```

The two lines of `ledger.py check` name `MR`, and neither names C-2026-10-31-27:

- «input-changed: MR C-2026-10-31-26 — the started of 2026-10-31T19:42:54Z hashes 1 input otherwise than the issued of 2026-10-31T19:09:34Z: .../PROMPT_BUILD_2026-10-31.md (sha256:2a9543ef8b76 at issue, sha256:a6167418b262 at start)»: another task, another session's start, not this round.
- «input-changed: MR C-2026-10-31-28 — the started of 2026-10-31T19:42:11Z hashes 1 input otherwise than the issued of 2026-10-31T19:36:07Z: .../REPORT_KIND_ITEM_2026-10-31_v2.md (absent at issue, sha256:69b0de25a5b8 at start)»: this review's own task; the report it reviews did not exist at issue, as the form says to expect.

Neither bears on the round under review.

## 7. The verdict: accepted — 0 gaps

Every test is met on evidence read, the figure agrees, each gap's line holds and would carry the cure, the page is unchanged since version 1's diff, and the cause of version 1's one gap (G1, form) is removed: A4 now exits 0.

## 8. Found, not fixed

1. **Model.** The round ran on claude-opus-5-5, the instruction names Sonnet; the report states it (§5).
2. **Page part 1 lags part 3.** Item 7 names a dependency declared one way, not one declared in neither, nor the fault proposed at `REVIEW_QUESTIONS_2026-10-31_v2.md:124` («To test whether positions can be built together on the counts alone ...»). Part 3 line 26 covers the check; the refusal in part 1 is not written. The orchestrator's to judge, as both earlier reports say.
3. **No page carries the commit gaps.** Instructions of the kind `none` for commits get "evidence outside both repositories" and the `0 missing, 0 extra` comparison only by copying PROMPT_COMMIT3 version 2.
4. **Ledger pins a path with a space as "absent".** The sixth input (`.../Library/Application Support/.../FINDING-KINDS.md`) is pinned as `~/Library/Application absent` in the `issued` and `started` entries; the trace check reads "5 of 5" and never hashes it. A ledger.py fault, found in edition 1 as well.
5. **Entries spell paths `~/IdeaProjects/mini-registry/...`**, not the Mac's real path (the `report:` lines of `show`).
6. **`started_by: unknown`** on the round's `started` entry, with the report saying a scheduled task started it; not shown by its prompt.
