# Review of the second attempt — the third commit of the day (version 2)

Evidence: `~/Documents/Dev/wai-demo/mini-registry/_working/round-commit3-v2-review/_evidence/` (`git_checks.out`, `b2_outputs.out`, `mechanical.out`, `exp_*.txt`, `diff_*.txt`). Every git command was read-only (`GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`). The report was present at its path and is judged as it stands.

## 7. Verdict: not accepted — 3 gaps

The commits themselves are sound (B1, B2, A2, A3, A6 hold on my own re-runs). Not accepted on a report-form fault, an omitted item, and a test B3 that cannot be met as written.

- **G1 (form)** — The report's `window` line is typed by hand, not the program's output, and gives no two ends to the second: it reads `started entry 20261031T192204Z; last write is this report`. The report form (`REPORT-template.md`, line 50) says the window is "the program's output, never typed", opens "with its two ends, each with its date and to the second", and names a hand-typed window as a fault of form. Its `outputs` line also gives no size or checksum per output (form, line 52). Breaks: the report form's `window` and `outputs` rows.
- **G2 (item)** — Instruction section 9 says "Record `ls -ld` of each place written." The report carries no such section. The only `ls -ld` anywhere is one line, for the evidence folder, in `final_checks.txt`. The two `.git` places and the report file are unlisted. Fails: section 9 of the instruction (it is not among B1 to B3, but it is an item of the task).
- **G3 (other: a test of the instruction that cannot hold)** — B3 asks that after step 5 the mini registry's status name "only this round's evidence and report". It names `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` too (` M`), which `ledger.py` rewrites on every ledger entry (my own `started` entry printed "rebuilt ..."). The round disclosed this honestly (report section 7, "Departure"). The cause is in the instruction, as G1 and G2 of the first edition were, not in the round. Fails: B3, literally.

Kinds: form=1 · item=1 · other=1. The page of the kind is `none`, so no page lacks a line. Because this is the second round of the act, the orchestrator may re-scope it rather than issue a third version (procedure 6.4); G3 would then be removed by naming `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` as an expected line, or by excluding it.

## 1. The tests of success

| Test | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **B1** status empty straight after the commits | Met. Both files are 0 bytes, listed in the round's evidence (`after_status_mini-registry.txt`, `after_status__coordination.txt`). They were recorded in a `mktemp` folder outside both repositories until after the commit, as the version-2 method asks. | `ls -l` of the round's evidence folder |
| **B2** committed set equals the "before" list | Met, by my own route. I expanded the round's recorded porcelain lists myself (`exp_*.txt`) and compared with `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD`: mini registry 23 and 23, coordination 15 and 15, `missing:` and `extra:` empty in both. | `b2_outputs.out` |
| **B3** status after step 5 | Not met as written (G3). Coordination names only the round's `finished` entry (and now also my `started` entry, which post-dates the round). The mini registry names the round's report and evidence folder, plus `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`. | `git_checks.out`, `b2_outputs.out` |
| **A2** one new commit each, no remote | Met. `e184746` sits on `7f8fa98`; `62659d9` sits on `f4c9345`. `git remote -v` printed nothing in either. Author is the configured Arne Laponin identity. | `git_checks.out` |
| **A3** nothing ignored committed | Met. `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` printed nothing in either. | `git_checks.out` |
| **A5** trace check | Met, with a note. The instruction's command names the first edition's report `REPORT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31.md`. I ran it over the second edition's report, as the report did: exit 0, "trace check: clean", 4 of 4 outputs exist. | `mechanical.out` |
| **A6** ledger entries | Met. `ledger.py show` prints the version-2 `started` (19:22:04Z) and `finished` (19:23:04Z) entries. | `mechanical.out` |

**The status lines now (task 3, A1 form).** The mini registry shows `M WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md`, `?? _reports/REPORT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31_v2.md`, `?? _working/round-commit3-v2/` and `?? _working/round-commit3-v2-review/`. The last is this review's own evidence. The coordination shows `?? _ledger/20261031T192304Z_MR_finished_C-2026-10-31-23.yaml` (the round's `finished` entry, expected) and `?? _ledger/20261031T192330Z_MR_started_C-2026-10-31-24.yaml` (this review's `started` entry, expected). `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` is the ledger program's rewrite (4 lines changed) and is no other line. I found no unexplained line.

## 2. One figure re-established

The number of files in each commit. The report counted from its own recorded lists. I used `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | wc -l` and cross-checked with `git ls-tree -r --name-only` of `HEAD` and `HEAD~1`. Mini registry: 23 files (4 modified and 19 added; `ls-tree` goes from 703 to 722 files, a net 19, plus 4 modified). Coordination: 15 files, all added (147 to 162). Both agree with the report. Times: the commits are stamped 21:22:19 +0200 (19:22:19 UTC), after the `started` entry (19:22:04Z) and before the `finished` entry (19:23:04Z), which fits. The report's `computer` and `model` lines agree with the `started` and `finished` entries.

## 3. Outputs exist

Report: 5,363 bytes, modified 21:23:12 local. Evidence folder: 21 files, `drwxr-xr-x`, `ls -ld` seen. Commits `e184746` and `62659d9` exist and are on top of the first edition's commits. `ledger.py`'s trace check found 4 of 4 outputs named. No output is missing. The `.git` places and the report file are the ones for which the report carries no `ls -ld` (G2).

## 4. The page of the kind and the running application

Not applicable. The kind is `none`, so there is no page and no application model.

## 5. Mechanical checks

Run by me, with output in `mechanical.out`:

- **Trace check** over the report: exit 0, clean.
- **Placement check and round-record check:** not run. This is not a routine round, the instruction names neither, and the round kept no record: the report's `record` line says "none" and the instruction says so. I record it as not run, as the task prescribes, and it is no gap.
- **`ledger.py show --code MR --id C-2026-10-31-23`:** exit 0. It prints the `issued`, `started` and `finished` entries of version 1 and the `issued` (19:19:05Z), `started` and `finished` of version 2. Account on the version-2 entries: all `(account removed)`, equal to the report's `account`. The `started` entry carries `started_by: unknown`, which matches the report. Version 2's `issued` names the first edition's review (C-2026-10-31-24) as its subject.
- **`ledger.py check`:** exit 0, "check: clean".

## 8. Found, not fixed

- The first edition's review, and these gaps, show the same pattern: the instruction's tests were written for a world where nothing else writes while the round runs. Both rounds' real failure was in the instruction. The orchestrator may wish to give the "expected line" list in one place.
- The instruction's A5 names the first edition's report path. For the second edition it should name `REPORT_COMMIT3_2026-10-31_v2.md`.
- `WHAT_IS_RUNNING.md` is a produced file under version control. Every ledger entry makes the mini registry dirty. That is a standing cause of the A1 and B3 trouble; the orchestrator may consider ignoring it or committing it as a matter of course.
- The report's `started_by` is `unknown`; correct, since the scheduled-task start does not show it.
- This review is run on Sonnet, the band its instruction names. Effort is unknown to this session (its start shows none).
